Every time I read a story like this, I think of how much we need ranked-choice voting in the US. Iâ€™m not inclined to vote for any Republican right now, but there are plenty Iâ€™d rank above these two if given the chance. I also wish I could have ranked Charles Booker AND Amy McGrath above Mitch McConnell back in November.
