I am only peripherally aware of Joe Rogan and donâ€™t get great vibes from what I see, so I donâ€™t really have any investment in how his podcast is doing. That said, this does speak to my concerns that Spotifyâ€™s attempts to land exclusive podcasts are threatening one of the last (and best) parts of the open web weâ€™ve managed to hold onto. Also, very interesting use of digital methods here!
