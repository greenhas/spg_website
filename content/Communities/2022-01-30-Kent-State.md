I picked this graphic novel from JCPL just over a week ago. I think that Backderf's art is weird, and I have mixed experiences with non-fiction comics, but I don't know much about the 1970 killing of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, and I decided it was worth knowing more about.

The story was compelling, and Backderf's art didn't bother me as much as I worried it would, so I'm glad I tried it. The story of the Kent State shootings stuck out to me as a difficult tale of the importance of non-violent protest and of curbing state power.
