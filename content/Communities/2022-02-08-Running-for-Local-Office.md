I've been interested in the idea of running for office since I was in high school, and as I've become more politically aware and engaged over the past five years, I've thought a lot in particular about eventually running for local office.

I picked this book up with a stack of others a couple of months ago during a particular rush of civic inspiration and since I got a notice that I needed to return it, I blazed through it in a couple of days.

The author is clearly right-leaning, and I wonder if I'd get a different perspective from an author with a different political perspective. I don't think that interfered too much, though and I learned a lot from the book, even if it wasn't life changing.

Seeing some of the nitty-gritty details involved in running for and holding public office did give me some pause, though. I honestly don't know if I have what it takes.
