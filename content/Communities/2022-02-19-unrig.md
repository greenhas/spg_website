This took me a while to read: not because i didn't like it, but because there were some parts that enraged me (in a productive way), so I couldn't trust myself to read it before bed for fear of getting too wound up to sleep.

I appreciated the book's straightforward approach to laying out problems with American democracy and its optimism that we can do something about it. This year, I've been wanting to think‚Äîand engage‚Äîmore in politics, and I think I'll find the last chapter of this book particularly helpful for giving me the motivation to do so. 

When I bought this at Joseph-Beth, I noticed other books from the same series there. After this good experience, I want to make sure to try some of the others.
