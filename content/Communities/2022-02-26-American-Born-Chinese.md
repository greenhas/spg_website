I grabbed this book at the library while dropping off some overdue items and read the whole thing that night before going to bed. Reread, rather‚ÄîI've read this book at least once before. It made a big impression on me at the time, even though I'm sure I wasn't particularly anti-racist then, and I loved it even more this time.

The art is great and the story is even better. It's an amazing comic with a powerful message, and I think I ought to buy a copy for kiddo to read when she's older. I already own Yang's *Superman Smashes the Klan*, which is one of my favorite comics, but I think this one might be even better.
