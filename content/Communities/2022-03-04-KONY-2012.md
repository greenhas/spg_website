KONY 2012 has been on my mind a lot lately, and this is a good read. It doesn't bring up why I've had it on the mind, though. I'm afraid Russia's invasion of Ukraine could turn into a sequel of sorts: Something important and meaningful that people glom onto because they see something oversimplified on social media.
