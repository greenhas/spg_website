I'm generally a fan of Doctorow's writing‚Äîhis recent collection of novellas ("Radicalized") is one of my favorites and I also own his entire "Little Brother" trilogy. This collection of stories just didn't land for me, though, and there are other stories/books of his that felt the same.

I wonder if his weirder, more optimistic stories don't work for me in the same way his bleak ones do. This collection dates to 2007, and while Doctorow has long been a critic of certain uses of technology, there are some stories in here that seem like they have more faith in the future of tech than I think is warranted in a post-Snowden, post-Cambridge Analytica world.
