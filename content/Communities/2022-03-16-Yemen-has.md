Yemen has been on my mind a lot since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but mostly because I'm belatedly realizing I haven't been paying attention. It's not that Ukraine doesn't deserve our attention, it's that Yemen has long deserved just as much. There, we're the ones complicit in civilian deaths, and we need to own up to that.
