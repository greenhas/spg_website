There are a few yellow flags in this article for me. Quick and efficient sounds good, but are those the most important values in policing? What values do they stand in tension with? It's great that there are policies against using a ALPR database for personal reasons, but these policies regularly get violated. No, these aren't videosurveillance cameras, but that doesn't make them harmless.
