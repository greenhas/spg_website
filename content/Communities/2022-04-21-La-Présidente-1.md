I think this is the third time I've read this BD, but given the ongoing French presidential election and the possibility that Le Pen will pull off a win on the 24th, I wanted to revisit it—and read the other volumes in the trilogy, which I've never done.

The BD isn't the best—it's overly didactic at times and the art aims for a photorealism that sometimes verges on the uncanny valley. The digital adaptation also complicates things—there's no panel-to-panel swipe like many Kindle comics, and it's hard to read on a phone. 

Still, I think that the message—a warning against what could happen if the far right took power in France—makes it worth a read. I'm interested to see what the next two volumes will bring.
