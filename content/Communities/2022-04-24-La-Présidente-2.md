I read this volume of the series much faster than the last one—perhaps because it was new to me and perhaps because the second round of the election motivated me to finish it—though I clearly won't finish the series before today's results were announced.

Thematically, I thought the book was stranger. It put more emphasis on how laws and politics established under mainstream parties could become terrifying in the hands of far right extremists. It was also helpful for learning more about other elements of France's far right.

All things considered, though, the same flaws are present. The photorealism doesn't work, it feels overly didactic and often strained and despite my sympathy for the story, it's just not great comics.
