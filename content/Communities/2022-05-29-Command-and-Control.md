This book me far too long to read. I started (and finished) a lot of books while supposedly reading this one, and it's just a massive book with a lot to get through.

I'm also unclear on how much I'll take from the book in particular. I got a lot from the overall arc of the story, but given the timeframe of my reading it and the sheer amount of material‚Äînot to mention Schlosser's interweaving of a particular nuclear accident and other historical details‚Äîit was hard to keep track of who was who and what had happened.

If I remain positive about the book, though, it's because it does such a good job of hammering home a central thesis that deeply resonates with me‚Äîthat nuclear weapons are an inherently dangerous technology and that it's a miracle that we haven't had any serious accidents with them.
