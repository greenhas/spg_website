So, so many wild things in this article. I grew up loving this hymn and had no idea it had roots in blackface minstrelsy. Hope the Church will take it out of its next hymnbook, but I'm not holding my breath. The real kicker is Brigham Young's concern about blackface—not because it's racist but because it's degrading to white people.
