I enjoyed reading this book but sometimes struggled with it. The Reorganization era of Community of Christ history remains largely new to me‚Äîthough I have enjoyed reading "Pragmatic Prophet"‚Äîbut I struggled some with the organization of the book. 

In short,, I enjoyed the content but it felt sometimes that the book was a dumping ground for relevant content rather than the weaving of that content into a clear, cohesive narrative. I didn't feel like I always understood Scherer's structural choices for the book, and that got in the way of really enjoying it.

This isn't going to stop me from reading Scherer's third volume, which I'm really excited for, but I am somewhat disappointed that this journey into unfamiliar territory wasn't more engaging.
