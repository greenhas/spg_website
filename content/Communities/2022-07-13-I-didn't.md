I didn't realize there'd been so much right-wing pushback against this awful, awful story. There's always room for good faith critical appraisals of the news, but what critics  seem to me to miss here is that even if it weren't true, the mere hypothetical possibility of something like this happening is shameful. That said, the emergence of more evidence supporting the claims is not a great look for those who called it into question.
