I'm glad the article identifies Art as an apostle for Community of Christ, to emphasize that it's entirely possible to be affirming and Christian. Coming from Mormonism, I'm not used to the idea of apostles standing up for queer causes, so as gross as the book removal is, I'm grateful for Art's example here.
