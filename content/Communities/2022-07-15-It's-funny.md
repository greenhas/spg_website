It's funny how conditional the GOP's concerns about free speech are. That's not to say that free speech isn't a complicated topic to be weighed in conjunction with other concernsâ€”it absolutely is. But if a party wants to use a simplistic view of free speech as a rallying cry, stunts like this show how just how simplistic that view is.
