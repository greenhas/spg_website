I don't know how much different Scherer's writing‚Äîwhich bugged me in Vol. 2‚Äîchanged for VOl. 3, but this period of recent history was fascinating to me and I couldn't get enough of this book. 

This volume captures Community of Christ becoming the denomination it is today, with all of the joys and struggles included therein. It was exciting to see the church struggle and adapt and grow‚Äîit made me happy to be part of this community. However, Scherer also doesn't shy away from the struggles and real problems faced by the church during this time‚Äîmany of which continue today. I feel responsibility and pressure to help the church survive and thrive, even though it scares me.
