This is a horrifying, sickening story. When it's marriage equality, the Church is eager to say that being legal doesn't make something right (a bad take, for the record), so to hear "it was fine because it was legal" as a defense for bishops' failure to report child sexual abuse (at Salt Lake's encouragement) is sickening.
