I've long lacked confidence in my own opinions (as a general ruleâ€”I can also be an opinionated jerk), so even the simplest disagreement with a position I've taken can take some wind out of my sails. When I read the official Latter-day Saint response to the recent AP story, I didn't agree with it, but it still slowed me down some. "Maybe I should consider things from another point of view," I thought. I do think it's important to consider things from all angles, and I don't think I have the full story, but Michael Austin's response is the right one gere. When we're talking about an instance where church inaction allowed for horrific child abuse to continue unchecked for SEVEN YEARS, complaining about unfair treatment in the press is not the right way to respond. Furthermore, if the church is upset by implications that it cares more about its public reputation than about victims of child abuse, responding the way it did only adds fuel to that fire. Again, Austin's response here is spot on.
