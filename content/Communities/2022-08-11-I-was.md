I was not aware of this episode of history, and I feel more informed for it. It's an example of where a Democratic president should be held to the same standard as Trump is being held right nowâ€”not out of any kind of whataboutism, but because both presidents crossed lines. In fact, "both" isn't right here: Nixon comes out of this looking as bad as (if not worse than) Johnson.
