On one hand, I strongly believe Trump should be held accountable for all laws he's broken or flouted. On the other, I believe that the Espionage Act has been used as a crude cudgel by several presidential administrations, and it's really important not to be sloppy here. The second doesn't outweigh the first, but just like one can defend the FBI raid without putting the FBI on a pedestal of infallibility, we need to be critically minded about all this.
