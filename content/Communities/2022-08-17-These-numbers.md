These numbers sound great, but what cost are we paying? I'm not talking about the $70,000, I'm talking about the hard to quantify costs of surveillanceâ€”which, as the ACLU of KY points out, are likely to disproportionately target communities of color. Except we can't know that because the city won't tell us where the cameras are.
