The inconsistency here is infuriating. When I was in grad school, I had the philosophy that I (a Mormon working toward a PhD) couldn't rule out the possibility of working at BYU. There's still a lot that I like and respect about BYU, but seeing the way they're putting the squeeze on their employees makes it clear that I could never have survived there.
