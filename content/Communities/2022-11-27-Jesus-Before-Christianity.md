This book took me far too long to read. I picked it up at a used book sale at the library because it looked really interesting. While it was a good, informative read, I had more trouble than expected getting into it, so I did a lot of stopping and starting and restarting and coming back to, etc...

I felt like the book didn't deliver on its promise of demonstrating the historical Jesus in the way I had hoped. I felt that the author was overconfident in some of the arguments he made and that he didn't take the time to lay out the evidence for those arguments in the way I would have hoped. 

In the end, though, I did end up learning a fair amount of what I wanted to learn, and Nolan made some good points that I wrote down and want to hold onto.
