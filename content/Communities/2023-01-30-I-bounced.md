I bounced pretty hard off of *Walkaway* a year or so ago, but I recently decided to give it another try. I felt like I needed a boost of hopeful thinking, and I'd seen Doctorow post about the book as being hopeful. Did it ever deliver! *Walkaway* is hopeful on a nearly religious level, and it was exactly what I needed. The book is not na√Øvely optimistic but rather tenacious in its belief that we can still make this a better workd. The audiobook was excellent, too, which I think made it easier to get back into it‚Äîand to read it so relatively quickly.
