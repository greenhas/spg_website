Parts of the first book haven't aged well (including some language that was bad enough to be edited out of the print version I have), and while I enjoy Doctorow's opinions, they sometimes overwhelm the story here. That said, to quote TVTropes, some anvils are worth dropping, and the messages about privacy, surveillance, and civil liberties are as relevant as ever, I don't know if I enjoyed the book as much as I did my first time through, but I still like it enough to give it four hearts.
