I put off watching this movie for a while, despite a number of recommendations. I think it's fitting that I finally watched it so soon after listening to the audiobook of *Walkaway*, a very weird Cory Doctorow novel about finding hope despite things going very badly. This movie is far, far weirder than *Walkaway*, and yet it also does a much, much better job of getting that same message across. I feel like it spoke to many of my current anxieties, but in a healing and helpful way. It's also the sort of movie I probably never would have watched as a devoutly practicing Mormon, but I'm glad that I've learned that films with references to butt plugs can also be deeply moving and even spiritually inspiring.
