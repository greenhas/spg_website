I don't know enough about OpenAI to evaluate these concerns, but I think these questions are important. The power of AI means that the companies that control them are also in a position of power, and it's important that we treat them critically. That said, while I do think making LLM code open source is probably better in the aggregate, it isn't without concerning drawbacks: The minute it was released under an open license, I'm sure Gab's Andrew Torba would be considering how to make a homebrew version that can't be content moderated.
