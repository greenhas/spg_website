My spouse and I watched all four seasons of this show more or less as they came out. The past few months have seen some pretty big changes to our family schedule, and we haven't has as much time to watch TV together, so we recently decided to rewatch The Good Place (since episodes are short). It's a very rewatchable show; you can get a lot out of it once you know what's yet to come. I enjoyed the first season the most the first time through, and upon rewatch, I have trouble imagining that will change in any way.
