Good for Andy. One thing I personally appreciate about Governor Beshear is that he so often invokes his faith as a Democrat. Granted, it's probably a calculated decision in such a red state, and I'm still uncomfortable with how faith and politics are intertwined in the U.S., but it shows that faith doesn't have to be queerphobic.
