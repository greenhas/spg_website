Even if the Kentucky GOP is right and this is what loses Beshear the election, it it was clearly the right thing to do. I want Beshear to stay in office, but I don't know if I could vote for him if he didn't resist the queerphobia coming out of the General Assembly. Shame on our legislature for passing this billâ€”and for so clearly acknowledging here that it's to score political points at the expense of Kentucky children.
