I am not an AI expert, and my concerns aren't on the existential scale. However, I do think it's important to avoid moving fast and breaking things with these powerful technologies. That isn't necessarily to say that more powerful AI shouldn't be released (though I'm already disinterested by the current stuff), just that racing to improve them for commercial benefit and as technological flourish doesn't strike me as socially responsible.
