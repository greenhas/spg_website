I appreciate Pyle's thoughts (and Star Trek references) here as he warns against allowing "peace and understanding" to neuter our opposition to evil. To be clear, that's not what Community of Christ—or even maybe Nelson—is calling for, and I know my own opposition efforts risk denying the humanity and dignity of those I oppose. It's a tricky balance, and I think Pyle's argument is one of many to consider.   [link to 'Some political movements among us deserving of being opposed and rendered powerless'](https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2023/04/05/seek-peace-understanding-george/)
