In my journey with Community of Christ, I've spent a fair amount of time thinking about what it means to pursue peace. I appreciate Pyle's thoughts (and Star Trek references) here as he warns against allowing "peace and understanding" to neuter our opposition to evil. To be clear, that's not what Community of Christâ€”or even maybe Nelsonâ€”is calling for, and I know my own opposition efforts risk denying the humanity and dignity of those I oppose. It's a tricky balance, and I think Pyle's argument is one of many to consider.
