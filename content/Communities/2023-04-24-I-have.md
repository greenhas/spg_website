I have enjoyed going through this book. It's the kind of book that invites personal action instead of just letting you read it, and that's felt overwhelming at times (particularly as my life has gotten busier in recent weeks), but it's a good invitation, and I know I'll need to revisit this slowly and deliberately to get the most out of it.
