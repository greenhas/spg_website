I'm a couple of days late on writing this post: I started listening to the audiobook within hours of Doctorow sending out Kickstarter rewards on Monday and had it finished within a day. I often introduce Doctorow to others by saying that his books sometimes read like op-eds‚Äîbut that that's a good thing. I found that to be true in this book. I don't know that I liked it as much as *Walkaway* (though I never expected to like that one!), and I'm honestly not sure I followed all of the plot details (my fault, not the author's). Despite all of this, I couldn't help but give this full marks. The point of the story is clear, inviting righteous indignation about poverty and wealth; the characters and world are lovingly detailed in a way that made it come alive; finally, Wil Wheaton's performance is excellent and only made the whole thing stronger (also, the end credits cracked me up). It's only been two days since I finished it, but my next audiobook is still on hold on Libby, and I've been seriously considering giving this one another listen while I wait.
