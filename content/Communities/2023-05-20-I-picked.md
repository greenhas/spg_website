I picked up a copy of this book at the 2023 World Conference of Community of Christ, after it being on my wishlist for some time. It does an excellent job of examining the subjectivity of Restoration scripture by tracing its evolution over time. I remarked to a friend earlier this week that it's a shame it was written in the 90s (and originally, the 60s) rather than now, when there's so much more available to do this kind of work. In some ways, large parts of the book feel like they've been replaced by the Joseph Smith Papers project; yet, there's still a lot to gain from this take.
