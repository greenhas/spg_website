Look, this is the kind of book that I bought knowing already that I'd agree with its thesis, so maybe you shouldn't read my review of it. Nonetheless, I think Caine does an excellent job of bringing together many of the arguments against Amazon. This company is bad news, and while it's hard to escape it entirely, I think the world would be a better place if more of us did less to support it.
