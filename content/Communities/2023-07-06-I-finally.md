I finally read this book weeks after picking it up from a local library and knowing I'd enjoy it. Viloria's life story (like so many others' stories) casually destroys sex and gender binaries. Reading about the experiences of intersex people was an important part of my beginning to reject those binaries several years ago, and I think anyone clinging to those binaries ought to hear from voices like Viloria's. That's not to say that other queerings of that binary are any less valid than being intersex, of course!
