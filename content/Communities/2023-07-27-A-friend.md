A friend recommended this book to me, and I'm very glad I tried it. It's a broad consideration of how the Binding of Isaac has been interpreted, imagined, and portrayed over the centuries‚Äîcombined with the author's personal struggles with the story. It was difficult sometimes as an audiobook (while I appreciated its breadth, it sometimes felt repetitious), but I got a lot out of it.
