I have been a fan of Delisle's for quite some time, but I'm still blown away by how good this is. The book isn't political or polemical, but a slice-of-life comic done by a cartoonist living in East Jerusalem for a year brings walls, checkpoints, rockets, and attacks on Gaza to life in a subtle, compelling way. I used to follow this news a lot more, and Delisle made me feel like there was a lot I missed even then. I'd love to pick up a copy in the original French.
