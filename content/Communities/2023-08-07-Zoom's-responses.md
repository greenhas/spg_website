Zoom's responses to this are meaningless, empty corporate speak. I'm not concerned about owning my content, I'm concerned about others using it while affirming my ownership. And yes, I "consent" to it in the sense that I use Zoom, but that is meaningless consent and Zoom knows it. What a garbage response.
