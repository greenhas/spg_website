I don't remember how I discovered this book, but when ordering some books from France early in the pandemic, I couldn't pass up the chance to read a Lebanese scholar's treatment of the Three Nephites in the original French. That said, while there were interesting bits in here, I just don't know that I follow academic French well enough to really get this. I have a PDF of the English translation that may be worth briefly revisiting.
