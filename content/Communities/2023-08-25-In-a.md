In a way, I'm not in a great position to evaluate this book, because I've read shamefully little about indigenous populations in the Americas. That learning experience here, though, was a good one. Treuer doesn't sugarcoat the past, but he celebrates the indigenous present and is even hopeful about the future. I have a lot more to read and learn, but this was a solid start.
