title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'President of Hungary Discusses Faith and Family Values at BYU'"

Look, I don't know much about Hungarian politics, but it seems to me that it would take a hell of a lot of self-confidence to brag about an ally of Viktor OrbÃ¡n visiting BYU. This feels like wading into the culture wars in a way that the LDS Church usually tries to avoid.
