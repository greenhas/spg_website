I've been attending Community of Christ for over three years now, and I'm still surprised by all the little things it does that the LDS Church would never do. Both churches were born with problematic attitudes towards indigenous peoples of the Americas, but while Community of Christ isn't perfect, I'm impressed with the steps it takes.
