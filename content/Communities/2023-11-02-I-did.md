I did not read this book as one is supposed to. It's a collection of daily Advent and Christmas reflections, but I listened to the audiobook well before Advent started and with no pauses in between individual reflections. I'm sure that takes away from the experience, but I enjoyed what I heard and plan to read more Bonhoeffer.
