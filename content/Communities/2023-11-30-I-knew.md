title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'Henry Kissinger has died at 100: his legacy in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China - Vox'"

I knew Kissinger's name, but I was embarrassingly unfamiliar with his record (especially given the many international relations and poli sci classes I took in college). This was a helpfulâ€”and difficultâ€”read. 

It's especially jarring to read this while reading up on non-violence and consuming fiction on the brutal cynicism of the cold war. There was a time in my life where I would have acknowledged the complexity behind these decisions, but I can't see how anyone could accept that complexity as somehow justifying the loss of life and other tragedies.
