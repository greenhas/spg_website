Over the weekend, I watched *The Muppet Christmas Carol* with kiddo for the third year in a row. That makes three years that I've been meaning to read the source material, so I went to LibriVox and found a free audiobook.

It was an excellent read! It's aged, and not always well, but the message is just as biting, and I appreciate the Muppet adaptation all the more. Dickens has clever writing, which I appreciated, and it was nice to read the original after seeing so many adaptations.

May the unfeeling wealthy of our day be visited with as many spirits as are necessary to change their hearts.
