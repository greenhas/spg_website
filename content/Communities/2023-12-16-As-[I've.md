As [I've written before](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/bethlehem-in-the-nativity-and-in-the-west-bank/), I'm skeptical when Christians see the Middle East uniquely through the particularities of our beliefs and traditionâ€”there's so many ways that can (and does) go wrong. Yet, if we're going to sing and preach about Bethlehem this year, we ought to use modern Bethlehem to get us thinking about a better world for the West Bank, Israel, and Gaza.
