I have a lot of small irritations with this book: I feel like Spong takes too long deconstructing before reconstructing (though that may reflect my own personal stage of faith), like his arguments are sometimes sloppy, and like he can be awkward (but clearly sincere) to modern eyes in his commitment to non-discrimination. He also seems more sure than I am that this is the obvious and only way to read Jesus; I agree with his reading, but I'm not sure it's as straightforward as he makes it. At the end of the day, though, I want to come back to this thinking. I'm reminded of Leo Tolstoy and G√©rard Siegwalt, and I appreciate his articulation of a non-theist Christianity. Lots to like here.
