Grant Hardy is doing great work with the Book of Mormon. I don't see the text the same way that he does, but I'm deeply grateful for what he's contributed to new readings of it, and I'm glad I have a copy if this.

It surprised me in this interview to learn that the LDS Church forebade a reprinting of the semi-official study edition Hardy had recently worked on. I found that to be a tremendously helpful text, and I'm glad I have a copy since it's apparently doomed to go out of print.
