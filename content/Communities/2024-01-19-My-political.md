title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'Macron Shifts Rightward, and Charts a New Course - The New York Times'"
---
My political views have shifted a lot over the past decade, and I think my attitude toward Macron demonstrates that pretty well. When he was first elected, I was pretty excited. I was fed up with the American right but not ready to identify with the left, and the idea of a new centrist party emerging out of nowhere was inspiring.

In the years since, though, I've moved steadily leftwardâ€”not least because Macron has demonstrated the ways that centrism tends to cede ground to the right on important issues. It's been disappointing to see.
