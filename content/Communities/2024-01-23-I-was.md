I was recently complaining about religious books that I felt were below where I am in my thinking, so this was a slice of humble pie. I don't do great with dense philosophical or theological works, and my rating is more a reflection of that than anything else. I made it through with an audiobook, but I don't know how much I'll retain.

Tillich came highly recommended by other authors, but I think that most of what I wanted to get out of it was concentrated in the final chapter of the book. I may have to revisit that section in text. There's much of interest in here—I just need to find a way to sit with it more effectively.
