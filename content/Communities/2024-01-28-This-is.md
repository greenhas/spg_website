This is a fascinating book written by two authors who began the project wanting to write about how cool it would be to settle space... but after consulting all the evidence, concluded that it might not be a great idea.

It's kind of a downer book in a way‚ÄîI've always been excited about space, and it's a bummer to think of it as an awful place where we might not have a future. I'm glad for the chance to re-evaluate my thinking, though!

As a final note, it is wild to read this at the same time I'm watching *For All Mankind*!
