I first read this book a few years ago, making my way through Ruff's books after enjoying Lovecraft Country. I might like this one just as much‚Äîit's bizarre to the point of absurdity but in a way that gets you to think. This reread was inspired by picking up a copy of my own from the clearance section of my favorite independent bookstore, and I'm really glad I own it.
