I enjoyed Nolan's movie so much that I thought I ought to eventually read the book‚Äîyet, I couldn't imagine that it could live up to the film adaptation (especially after hearing the audiobook narrator's awful attempts at any language other than English).

Yet, this ended up being amazing‚Äîperhaps better than the movie. Funnily enough, I felt that the best parts weren't about the man himself. Rather, his life provides fascinating insight into the existential horrors of nuclear weapons, the authoritarian impulses of McCarthy-era conservatism, and lots more besides. Lots to think about in this book!
