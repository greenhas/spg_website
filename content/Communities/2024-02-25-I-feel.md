I feel like I say this whenever I talk about Doctorow, but I love that his fiction reads like an op-ed. While waiting for this book to come out, I've been slowly reading his co-authored book *Chokepoint Capitalism*, and I feel like *The Bezzle* is all his (and Rebecca's) critiques about large and greedy companies wrapped up in a fun, action-driven narrative.

Here's the thing about me: I'm an academic, and I respect facts, reason, and citations. However, when those are the basis of an argument, I sometimes also struggle with feeling like I need to be better read and know all the angles before I can get on board with the argument. A narrative, on the other hand, sucks me in and convinces me. I ended this book feeling angry about prisons, DRM, and unscrupulous corporations and their executives‚ÄîI'm on board with the argument. That the story was exciting and fun to follow was only a plus.

So, yes, this is Doctorow at his best, and I'm excited to see how the last book in the trilogy turns out.
