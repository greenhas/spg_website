This probably deserves a higher score: I don't know that the New Testament is best read "cover to cover" (it's not that kind of book), and I was listening to it via audiobook, which is even less ideal.

I really appreciate what Hart is up to, but I don't feel like I *got it* reading it in this way. I'm sure I'll come back to this translation when considering specific passages, though!
