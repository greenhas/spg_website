I've read this a couple of times in the past, but I wanted to give it another read specifically as anarchist fiction. I've enjoyed other books with anarchist themes, so I wondered how this would read through that lens.

I can see why this book is considered a classic, but it just doesn't really resonate with me. The art isn't my favorite, and while some of the ideas are interesting, the execution sometimes feels clunky.

Even politically, I wasn't terribly impressed. Yes, fascism is bad, and we should all rise up to resist it, but I didn't feel like Moore makes a compelling argument for V's ends or means.
