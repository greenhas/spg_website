This rating isn't fair! I've praised this book in the past, and it really is an excellent introduction to modern Community of Christ theology. I just happened to reread it at a time where I'm hungering for something different in terms of theological writing, so this rating reflects what I got out of the book in this moment, not all that the book actually has to offer.
