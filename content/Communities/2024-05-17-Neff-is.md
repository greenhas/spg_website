Neff is one of the most influential figures in the recent history of Community of Christ. On my second read of this biography, I'm less comfortable with some of the imperial and colonial aspects of RLDS expansion in the late 1960s, but for all Neff's complicity in those attitudes, he also worked hard to shed his own (and his church's) ethnocentrism and exclusivity, and I appreciate that. I've joked about this before, but it's wild that he was a contemporary of Ezra Taft Benson.
