After my last read was such a guilty pleasure (still not sure if I'll bring myself to read the next Honor Harrington or if it's just not worth it), I decided I needed some Doctorow so I could read something fun and meaningful.

This isn't my favorite of Doctorow's, but it's good! The more I read of his, the more I see the cross-cutting themes, the elements that get recycled from book to book, the earlier versions of plots that I've read in his more recent stuff.
