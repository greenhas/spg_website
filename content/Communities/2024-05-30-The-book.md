The book seems to be beloved in Community of Christ: I've heard a member of the First Presidency recommend it on a podcast, I've seen an emeritus senior president of seventy recommend it in the Herald, and this copy was given to me by an apostle. I can see why! It's interesting, full of important observations, and I think Community of Christ will need to adopt some of these ideas to survive in the decades to come (at least in the Global North).

That said, as an academic, I wanted to see more data and a clearer methodology underpinning these arguments instead of the anecdotes and generalizations that seem to make up the book's foundation. If there are two things that drive me nuts, it's `n.0` metaphors and sweeping statements about generations or groups of people‚Äîboth of those abound in this book, so as much as I appreciated its core ideas, I reserve some skepticism.
