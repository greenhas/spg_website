I had started listening to the recent Audible adaptation, believing that it was a BBC adaptation, but between not loving Audible and it feeling overdone, I ditched it pretty quickly and found this actual BBC adaptation instead. For bonus points, Christopher Eccleston is in the lead role!

I feel like it's the kind of adaptation that you have to know the original to really appreciate, but that doesn't make it bad. I haven't read the novel for years but still enjoyed it.
