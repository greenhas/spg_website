I heard this book reviewed on *The Incomparable*, and it sounded up my alley despite mixed reviews on the podcast, so I gave it a try!

This feels like a Cory Doctorow book in all the right ways: It has super weird ideas in it, and it's sometimes more about worldbuilding and a pretty clear "moral of the story" than specific plot beats or characterization. The morals of the story are good ones, though, and having a viewpoint character who's a sentient train is right up my alley.
