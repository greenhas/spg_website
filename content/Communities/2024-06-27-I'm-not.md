title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'Oklahomaâ€™s State Superintendent Requires Public Schools to Teach the Bible'"

I'm not necessarily opposed to teaching the Bible in public schools, but if you're going to do it, you should do it right: Compare and contrast the creation accounts, discuss different authors' conflicting takes on issues, and treat it as literature. That's clearly not what Walters is advocating for, and his approach is indefensible.
