If I understand correctly, this book was recommended in the curriculum for Community of Christ Reunion camps this year; at least, I listened to it because it was recommended for the Reunion that I attended last weekend. I actually finished it on Monday, but it's been a busy week, and so it's taken me a while to write this review.

While I am an aspirational environmentalist, I'm not very in tune with nature, so I wasn't sure how I'd like the book. That said, I really appreciated the author's respectful challenging of dominant scientific paradigms, something that is professionally important to me. Her critique of consumerist greed also stood out to me. I got a lot from this book, and I think I'll be blogging more about it in the future.
