Look, I've been trying to approach the SCOTUS decision with an open "I'm not a legal expert" mind, but I think this quickly demonstrates how dangerous the decision is. There's no way this is an official act, and Trump's insistence that it could be shows his confidence that he can get away with what he wants as president. This is not good for democracy.
