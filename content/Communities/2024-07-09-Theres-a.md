There's a certain flavor of bizarre that makes for great fiction, and this comic is that. It's a story about gender transition and transphobia, a critique of tech bros and libertarian business types, and... a science fiction story featuring a Cthulhuesque cult? There's a bit more gore than I normally tolerate in comics, and the art style isn't what I'd identify as my go-to preference, but everything fits together in a surreal but profound way.
