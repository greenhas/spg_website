Once you read enough Cory Doctorow, you start to pick up on the story elements that he reuses and recycles, and that's pretty obvious here. Not only is this a graphic novel adaptation of a short story, but it's very close to the premise of *For the Win*, too. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though!

In fact, I really like this comic. The plot is interesting, and the art is AMAZING. The story doesn't bog you down and treats the reader as though they're smart enough to keep up. My only complaint is that there are a couple of plot elements (in the main comic and the bonus one) that would benefit from a bit more explanation. Other than that, though, I think this is great, and I can't wait for my kid to be old enough to read it.
