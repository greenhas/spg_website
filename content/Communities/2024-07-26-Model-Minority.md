This is one of the most interesting riffs on Superman and Batman I've ever read (though, of course, their serial numbers are carefully filed off). It's a fascinating exploration of race, prejudice, technology, and police excess. I can't remember if I've read this any time except the first, but it's one I need to read again and again.
