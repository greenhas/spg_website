This is one novella in Doctorow's "Radicalized" collection, so I guess I could wait until I read all four and review them together, but I'd rather do four separate reviews.

This story is so, so good. It's an excellent anti-DRM screed and a compelling example of the social harms that can be done by technology to marginalized groups.

Reading this back in 2019 is what got me (back) into Doctorow's fiction, because it's a perfect example of what he does best. I love this story, and I assign an excerpt from it to my students in one class every time I teach it.
