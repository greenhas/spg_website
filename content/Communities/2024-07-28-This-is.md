This is also a darker novella, and reading a post-apocalyptic story that touches on death and disease stresses me out. More than the last time I read it, though, I get what Doctorow is going for with this story. It's a critique of survivalist go-it-on-your-own mentalities with optimism that even in the worst of times, humans can come together and help each other out‚Äîif they're willing to try. I don't like reading the story, but I appreciate the message.
