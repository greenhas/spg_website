This is a goofy but fun book about demon hunters from a 1990s evangelical church. It came highly recommended by Cory Doctorow, which is why I checked it out from my local library even though I wasn't sure it would be my thing.

I enjoyed reading it, but I *don't* think it was my thing after all. I followed enough of the 1990s gags and enjoyed enough of the story to have a good time. I also appreciate the more nuanced take it had on religion and demon hunting (the final battle is very ecumenical, including a Wiccan coven). This isn't a genre that I love, though, and for all the good bits of the story, nothing stood out as amazing.
