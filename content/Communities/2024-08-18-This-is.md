This is another one of those books that's hard to review‚Äîin part because it wasn't always easy to get through. I've owned it for a while and tried to get through the ebook a couple of times, but it wasn't until checking out the audiobook before some long drives this weekend that I finally made it through.

The book is wonky, and while that's a good thing, I confess that I didn't follow all the details in either the laying out of the problem or the articulation of the solutions. I followed the general thesis of the book, and I'm rating it highly because of my appreciation for that thesis, but I think I'd need to return to individual chapters before I could teach about any particular issue or endorse a corresponding strategy.
