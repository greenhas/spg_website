Prisoners got punished for taking advantage of a hilarious exploit in an app for transferring money from their commissary accounts to a private company's media store, but no one at that private company is being held accountable for unironically describing prisons as a "growth industry."

This sounds like something Doctorow would have made up for *The Bezzle*, and it's kind of amazing that I'm reading it in the news instead.
