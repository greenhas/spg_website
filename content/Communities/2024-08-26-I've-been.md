I've been trying to think through Durov's arrest since I first heard about itâ€”there are a lot of complex things going on here. I think this captures nicely my thoughts and taught me a few things, too.

Telegram is a sketchy platform (technically even more than in terms of content), but that doesn't mean arresting the founder is warranted. Yet, *that* doesn't mean that outcry on the right is in good faith, either.
