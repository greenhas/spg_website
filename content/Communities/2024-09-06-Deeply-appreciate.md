Deeply appreciate Masnick's writeup. I don't know the ins and outs of the law, and that's given me some pause in being upset about the ruling. To see a lawyer find fault with so much gives me greater confidence in my own frustration.

The most dangerous part, though, doesn't require a law degree to understand. The logic of the findings poses a threat to all libraries, not just this one.
