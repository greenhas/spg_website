I'm bookmarking this episode for later because it does a better job than I've ever heard of talking about how messy and complex and difficult it can be to have Mormon roots in Community of Christâ€”and it doesn't even get into some of the "outside Utah" vs. "in Utah" dynamics that I personally think get overlooked.
