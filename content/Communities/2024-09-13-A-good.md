title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'Big publishers think libraries are the enemy'"
---
A good take by Molly White. I remember when I stopped thinking about ebooks in terms of screens (as opposed to paper) and started thinking about them in terms of DRM (as opposed to free use). DRM helps the already powerful at the expense of everything else, and I want to do more to push back against it.
