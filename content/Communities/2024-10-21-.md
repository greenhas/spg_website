I picked this book up at an anarchist bookstore in Asheville, North Carolina. Of all the books I was considering, this one seemed the most likely to give practical advice: How can we practice anarchist forms of living today?

Horowitz never uses the word anarchist—which doesn't bother me—but it's also more ruminations and abstract ideas than specific calls to action. I enjoyed the book fine and "appreciate its rhetorical goals" (to quote Dan McClellan), but it wasn't as helpful as I hoped in terms of concretely imagining better futures.
