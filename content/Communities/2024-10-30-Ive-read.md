I've read a number of books on Mormonism and race, but this one might be the most compelling. Its focus on the 20th century is important, and it has the most thorough discussion of the 1978 lifting of the priesthood and temple ban that I've ever seen. It's maddening to see all these details in one place, but I'm grateful that Harris made that available to readers.
