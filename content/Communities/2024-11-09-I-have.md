I have Ward's *Anarchism in Action* waiting for me on my nightstand while I work through a Jimmy Carter biography, so I thought I'd listen to this on hoopla in the meantime (since I regularly do an ebook, an audiobook, and a print book in parallel). It's an interesting and helpful overview of a political philosophy that I'm still trying to understand. Lots more to be read, but this gives some context.
