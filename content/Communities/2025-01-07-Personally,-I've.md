title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'Meta abandons fact-checking on Facebook and Instagram in favor of Community Notes'"
---
Personally, I've come around to the idea that fewer restrictions, "Community Notes"-style responses, and lots of personal control over what one sees **could** work better as content moderation. It's interesting to see Bluesky take some of these approaches, for example!

Here, though, this seems like it's bending the knee to the Trump administration, and I can't imagine any of this being done in good faith. What a disappointment Meta continues to be.
