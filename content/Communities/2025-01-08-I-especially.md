I especially appreciate this article in the wake of Meta's recent announcements. There **are** cases in which content moderation is inconsistent or overreaching, and there **are** cases in which less moderation fixes the problem. However, it's the arbitrary distinctions and self-serving nature of the changes that make the "free expression" argument so flimsy.
