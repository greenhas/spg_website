So, I actually finished this last week and am behind on bookblogging. It's the third time I've read this book (twice on audio), but with the final book in the trilogy coming out next month, it was time to revisit the earlier ones.

This book is fun in an action movie sense while also being a searing critique of wealth and of our society's seeming inability to take care of the poor. Wil Wheaton does great narration on the audiobook, and it's just an enjoyable listen all around.
