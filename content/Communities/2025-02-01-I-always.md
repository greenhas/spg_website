I always appreciate Sam's writing and especially here. I'm waiting to see whatâ€”if anythingâ€”my current church has to say about the current mess, but I have a deep fondness for the church I grew up in, and it's deeply disappointing for a rich church that is willing to throw those resources behind its interests to decide that combatting the present cruelty is not one of those interests.
