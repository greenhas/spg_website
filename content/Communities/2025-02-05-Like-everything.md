Like everything I've read from Graeber, I appreciate the overall argument that he's making and I find the evidence he marshalls compelling. At the same time, there's a density to the latter that I admit having trouble following, so I don't always see how it leads to the overall argument.

Even with those caveats, I'm happy to endorse this read. I'm interested in how Graeber explores the relationship between moral thinking and economic modeling‚Äîas I posted earlier, I also find his thoughts on the moral dangers posed by abstracting interpersonal obligations into quantifiable debt with the help of money.

I imagine I'll want to come back to this one!
