title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'How close is Elon Musk to controlling a nuclear weapon?'"

The headline is a little provocative, but it's scary that we live in a world where it makes some sense.

More broadly, though, I found that the first Trump administration converted me to nuclear disarmamentâ€”yes, *this* president is scary, but that *any* president has access to that much destructive power is scarier still. I expect I'll go further in that direction this time around.
