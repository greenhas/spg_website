This book has been on my radar for a few months, and I'm glad to have found an audiobook I could check out (though I doubt I'd have regretted an impulse buy‚Äîthis would be a good book to have on hand). 

Palestinian Christian ministers and theologians always call me to account in a way that I appreciate. I don't think I should need someone from my own faith tradition (broadly speaking) to tell me how bad the situation in Palestine is (i.e., I should have already figured that out by now), but this book pushed my thinking in ways that are going to stick. I'm more informed than many on Israel and Palestine thanks to a few classes in college, but this still brought in new perspectives that had never really landed before.
