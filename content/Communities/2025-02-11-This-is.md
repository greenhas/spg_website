This is an excellent graphic novel adaptation of the earliest of Mormon history. The art is good, the story is compelling, and I enjoyed reading it. I came close to buying this twice in the past year after finding it in comics shops, and I was delighted to find that my local library had a couple of copies.

I do wish that I either knew a lot more history or a lot less history going into this. The details of Joseph Smith's life and early Mormon history are sometimes sparse or ambiguous; more importantly, they're hotly contested. I don't mind at all a critical take on Smith, but even though the author is clearly respectful of the historical figure even with his warts and all approach, there's a deeply ingrained Mormon skepticism in me that wonders if any of the choices verged on the salacious. That's not a critique of the book so much as a personal observation and a wish that I could have enjoyed the story while setting aside the instinct to be skeptical of non-LDS tellings of the history (which is all the more ridiculous given that I'm going on 5 years of not practicing in that faith).

At any rate, this deserves to be among the "great Mormon comics."
