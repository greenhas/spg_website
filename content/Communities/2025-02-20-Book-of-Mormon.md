Taking a moment to remember that the Garden of Enid webcomic is a pinnacle of Mormon arts.

![Enid, from the eponymous webcomic, holds a copy of the Book of Mormon and says "This is the Book of Mormon. It tells the story of two societies that caused their own demise by hoarding wealth, following crooked leaders, stigmatizing the poor, making war, and manipulating the oppressed. OH! And SECRET COMBINATIONS... they loved those. Good thing we've been so much wiser in our day."](/2025-02-20-Book-of-Mormon.JPEG)
