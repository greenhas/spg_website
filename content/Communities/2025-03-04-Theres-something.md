There's something especially dark about the voice actor who played Wallace (of Wallace and Gromit) starring as a na√Øve Englishman in this story about the horrors of nuclear war.

I've wanted to read the book this is based on for quite some time‚Äîand may yet read it now that I've found a copy on the Internet Archive‚Äîbut I got to the radio adaptation first. The couple at the heart of the story are so na√Øve as to make the story heavy-handed, but it's also a good literary device for just how helpless one is in the face of nuclear weapons.
