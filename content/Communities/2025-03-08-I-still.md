I still want to read the original comic that this and the radio adaptation were based on, but the Internet Archive copy is hard to read, and I had some work to do this afternoon that made it easy to put this on in the background.

I liked this a lot (well, "liked" as much as one can appreciate a black comedy horror story about nuclear war. Some of the experimental animation choices and blending of animated and film footage seemed odd, and I'm torn between appreciating them and finding them distracting. I think the movie does its job, though, and the na√Øvet√© of the characters landed more with me this time, as symbolic of our helplessness against nuclear weapons.
