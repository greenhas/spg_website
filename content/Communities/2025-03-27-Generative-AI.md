Generative AI products make me mad, I don't like them, and I'm not going to defend them. That said, if this gets framed as a copyright problem, is there any way to give Studio Ghibli (or Pixar or the Seuss estate) power to cry foul here that doesn't also shut down fan art, parodies, and the like? I'm skeptical, and that's why I think "labor" is the more productiveâ€”if more legally ambiguousâ€”framing here.
