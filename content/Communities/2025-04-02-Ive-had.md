I've had this on my radar since listening to the audiobook and thought I'd give it a try. It is terminally 80s in some ways (I liked the music anyway, but the sound effects felt like bad Doctor Who), but there were some excellent choices for adapting it to radio.

It kept what I found interesting about the book: depicting the possibility of another way of living but without settling for na√Øve utopia. It's strategically ambiguous, and the main character isn'f fully sympathetic (drunken sexual harassment will knock anyone off a pedestal), leaving the listener with plenty to think through.
