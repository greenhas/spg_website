This sort of thing reminds me why I'm so entrenched in my skepticism of generative AI. There's an uncritical insistence that the world needs AI, that America should be first in AI, and that we're just going to have to increase energy production instead of ask ourselves if that's worth the cost. Credit to Trump, I guess, for illustrating just how dangerous all these attitudes are.
