This book makes an interesting, important, and compelling argument. I find it personally interesting, and it will be useful for a conference paper that I'm thinking of putting together next fall (it turns out that Jacques Ellul's ideas overlap with the Book of Mormon in interesting ways!).

If I'm hard on the book, it's because that argument feels scattered. While I appreciate the mountain of sources that the author draws on, I feel like a shorter, tighter book (or even article!) could make the case just as well and with fewer digressions.
