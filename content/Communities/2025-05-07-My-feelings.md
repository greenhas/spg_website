My feelings toward generative AI are strong and negative, and I try not to share everything critical I read so that I'm not beating that drum over and over. This is worth a read, though: Generative AI is a great tool for trolling and Bannonesque "flooding the zone," and the Trump administration's use of it in these petty ways is arguably just as worrying as DOGE's irresponsible appeals to AI. I just don't like what these tools are doing to usâ€”and as its supporters point out, this is the least powerful they'll ever be. Hooray for the future, I guess.
