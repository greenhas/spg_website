This is the third (or fourth, if you count a quote-pulling skim) time I've read this book in the past 2ish years, and I do think that I need to give myself more of a break before trying to come back to it again. I really like the audiobook, though, and I'm glad I now own it in mp3 and epub. I also needed the read, since it's a hopeful one, and I started it when I was in desperate need of something hopeful. I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I did the first few times I read it, but I think that's from story fatigue‚Äîit remains one of my favorite books of all time and one that I will reference over and over again throughout my life, I'm sure.
