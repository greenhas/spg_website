Listened to Jason talk about this story on the 404 podcast while doing dishes last night (interspersed with watching clips of Moneyball, which I've never seem), and so I came back to skim the original article. 

I don't really care about baseball, so maybe I'm not allowed to have this opinion, but this all seems like a hellscape that Jacques Ellul's *technique* explains pretty well.
