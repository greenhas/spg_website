This was a hard book to read, but I'm glad I did. Munther is a Palestinian Christian pastor, and his holy anger and hurt in this book really spoke to me. However, I have a lot of internalized resistance to what he has to say, and things feel so big, and I spent a lot of the book tensing up and feeling overwhelmed. I feel called to repentance by this book, and I'm glad I read it before next week's Community of Christ World Conference, where a resolution standing against Christian Zionism will be debated.
