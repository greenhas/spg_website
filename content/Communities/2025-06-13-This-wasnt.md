This wasn't quite what I was expecting (I think the "biography" subtitle is misleading), but it's good! It's organized around specific understandings or depictions of Jesus in Mormonism, and while it isn't afraid of exploring the weird and controversial (I may be citing this at some point for a paper that touches on arguments about a polygamist Jesus), it's also good about contextualizing Mormon beliefs within broader trends, thereby making (some) things (slightly) less weird. I've had this book for a while and am glad to have finally read it!
