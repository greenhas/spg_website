Arca isn't perfect—the plot moves at the speed of convenience, the characters aren't terribly deep, and the twists are either predictable or "huh?"

Even with those critiques, though, I nearly gave it full marks, because it's really good. I love the art and panel design, and the dystopia as metaphor for modern social problems lands really well. I really enjoyed the read!
