This book isn't the best of the anarchist fiction I've read‚Äîit feels a bit stilted or maybe even *too* didactic at points‚Äîbut it grew on me, and I enjoyed the story a lot. (It's also not the worst anarchist fiction I've read‚Äîlooking at you, *V for Vendetta*). Cory Doctorow mentioned Killjoy's most recent book on his blog, so I'm giving some of her older stuff a try, and so far, I think it's pretty good.
