Karen Hao's *Empire of AI* really emphasized for me how much stock is being put in AGIâ€”especially as a motivator for AI companies. I am fine wirh concepts being hard to define, but I do think things get tricky when you can't articulate how you'll know when you've met the goal that serves as your *raison d'Ãªtre*.
