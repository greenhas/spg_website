Surely this is a reasonable price to pay for the Nazi-praising Grok to "discover new physics" within the next year, as Elon promised last night. 

This kind of thing is why I hate "the genie is out of the bottle" arguments. I can't help but hear them as "yes, people are going to create more CSAM, but all we can do is instead teach people to use these tools more responsibly."

Anyway, here's a [gift link](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/technology/ai-csam-child-sexual-abuse.html?unlocked_article_code=1.VU8.vSFS.dqPDldZrSeUN&smid=url-share) or whatever.
