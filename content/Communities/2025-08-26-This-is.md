This is horrifying. Reading the headline is one thing, but reading some of the details is stomach-churning. I'm not a lawyer, and as disgusted as I am with this, I don't know what legal liability should look like here. I feel more comfortable describing this as ethically bankrupt, though. I think I would have many fewer concerns about generative AI if it weren't a platformized consumer product. Whatever the right legal response to this is, OpenAI has some moral responsibility for this sort of thing.
