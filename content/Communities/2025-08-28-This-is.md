This is good! It's another book that I took too long to read, so it's hard to review when I took breaks for other books between sections.

It's a very Doctorow book. I mean this in three ways: First, it makes an impassioned plea for a niche-but-important tech cause. Second, it overlaps with his fiction writing in really obvious ways. Third, it reads like an extended blog post (which I mostly mean as a compliment).

I have *Enshittification* on preorder, and this felt like a solid warmup. Looking forward to reading that!
