Wow! Sure, coming from outside the LDS tradition, I have some theological quibbles with parts of this book, but what an amazing example it is of what I love about this series. It uses a close reading of the Book of Mormon‚Äîand some of the most obscure and overlooked parts of the Book of Mormon‚Äîto draw lessons that I can really get behind. It makes me want to already revisit the book and to the passages that it's working with.
