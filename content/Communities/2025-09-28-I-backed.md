I backed this Kickstarter project several years ago, when a comic about Mormonism felt like it was right in the center of the Venn diagram of my interests. That's still not far from the truth, but my relationship with Mormonism‚Äîand my experience as a Latter-day Saint missionary‚Äîis a lot more complicated than it was then.

In fact, I've been thinking about rereading this for ages but have bounced off of it a few times. I have big theological disagreements with some comics in the anthology, and I'm not a huge fan of the implicit queerphobia in at least two comics. 

So, I expected to grit my teeth through most of this, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it once I finally powered through. With a couple of exceptions, the range of art styles is a lot of fun, and most of the stories feel familiar as the kind of good memories I keep of my mission rather than the parts I don't like revisiting.
