Ellul can be hard to review, and especially in this book! The core metaphor here is interesting and useful—I plan to draw from it personally and professionally. It's also combined, though, with wild assertions, exegesis and theology that don't land (for me), and moral panic that might be intentional hyperbole or might just be off base.

So, there are some parts of this that are excellent and some parts that don't really work. That makes it hard to evaluate as a whole!
