I probably ought to rate this book higher. Even if I'm not terribly interested in psalmic structure and how it applies to the Book of Alma, there are some fascinating readings of familiar characters and stories in this book. In particular, Turley's reading of Ammonihah and "fire and brimstone" has really impacted me, and I want to spend more time with it.

In fact, that's ultimately what keeps me from rating the book higher. I'm powering through this series and more often skimming than reading. I don't regret that if it's the price I pay for finally making my way through all twelve volumes, but it does mean it's hard to truly evaluate some of these books.
