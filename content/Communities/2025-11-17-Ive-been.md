I've been meaning to reread this for a while, and I'm glad I finally got to it. It's fifteen years old now and feels it sometimes (not necessarily in a bad way), but it's a fun read.

I appreciate Doctorow's use of MMOs as a metaphor for economics, and even if I'm not economically savvy enough to follow all the details or evaluate their accuracy, it's a lot of fun to read about "Great Recession, but a heist carried out by unionized workers."
