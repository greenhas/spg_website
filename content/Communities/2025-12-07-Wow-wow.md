Wow, wow, wow. I was intrigued by what I knew about this book when I first bought it but am only now getting to it, five years later. It's a beautiful book and quietly radical, using the story of Mormon to develop a theology of the world ending around us. Miller explicitly invokes the climate crisis at the end of the book and calls for disciples to be willing to sacrifice all things instead of simply waiting to lose all things. Even outside of that context, Miller's quasi-mystical reading of Mormon has so much to offer—and is pleasantly aligned with some of the theologies I've heard in Community of Christ. This is a good one.
