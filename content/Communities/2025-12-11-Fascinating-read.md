Fascinating read! I'm not as interested as the author in his largely geopolitical thesis, but the raw materials he uses to construct that thesis are depressingly fascinating. They could also make up the elements of an Ellulian thesis on the dangers of power, efficiency, and technical systems. It's harder to use Apple products after reading the book—and it's a stark reminder of how the world we live in is so different than the world I'd like us to.
