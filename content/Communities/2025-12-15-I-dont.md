I don't agree with everything in the book, but it's full of great observations that I would gladly tweak to draw slightly different, really powerful conclusions. The author's "reader-centered theology of scripture" is great, and its meditations on the weakness of God also really spoke to me. This made Ether more interesting than I remembered it being, and I'm grateful for that.
