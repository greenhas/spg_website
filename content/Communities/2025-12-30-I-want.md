I want to describe this series as equally over-the-too and restrained, which feels contradictory, but I stand by it. It doesn't take the time to overexplain the misogynistic dystopia of its world, it just lets it happen and gives space for the reader to react. And yet, it's also intentionally campy, too! It's interesting!
