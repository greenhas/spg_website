Cory Doctorow has a bit he returns to in a lot of his writing about how tech billionaires aren't geniuses, just power-hungry people who got lucky, and now I will always wonder if he got it from this movie. I'm a huge fan of Cory's, but Rian Johnson's having Daniel Craig rant about how dumb Edward Norton's tech billionaire character is in this movie is perfection.

Also, super good cameo appearance by The Verge. 

I have read plot summaries and the TVTropes page for this movie several times, but nothing was as good as watching it. It was terrible, powerful person revenge fantasy that feels very good in 2026.
