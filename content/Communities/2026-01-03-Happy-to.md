Happy to have wrapped up this series, though I'm sure I'll be coming back to each of the titles. This last book has some good stuff in it (including a fascinating, existential discussion of the tension between grace and agency), but I found too much of it to be boring rather than captivating. I think that's probably my fault in part—as I've previously noted, I've been powering through these books just to finish them—but it's how things stand right now.
