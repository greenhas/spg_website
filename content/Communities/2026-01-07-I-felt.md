I felt the same way about this book that I often feel about Graeber's work: I like where he's going with things, but I'm not always convinced in the details.

So, the thesis of this book is great, and the last few chapters won me back when I was feeling a bit skeptical. Even with Graeber's concessions about his data, though, his conclusions sometimes felt tenuous, and I'm not sure we needed the taxonomy of bullshit jobs to get to the conclusions he wanted to draw in the end.

I'm glad I read it, and I'd be happy to revisit it (in fact, reading this made me want to revisit the other Graeber books I own), but I think it's worth being critical about the details.
