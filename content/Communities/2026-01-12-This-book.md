This book is great! I have some quibbles—I found Brueggemann a bit more literal in his exegesis than I would have expected—but I get why this is a classic, and I'll have to buy a print copy to reference in the future.

As I noted yesterday, I think there's a lot in here that also appears in the anarchist writing that's appealed to me lately: refusal of the status quo, skepticism of power, and the audacity to imagine a better world. It's good stuff.
