There are lots of stories circulating on social media that I try wait to read a full article on before I get angry about them. Here's the article, and it's as bad (worse?) as every post I've seen about it on Bluesky.

> The Columbia Heights Public School district says federal agents have detained four of its students in four separate incidents over the last two weeks. One child is a 5-year old boy who attends a district elementary school and was used as “bait” to draw family members out of their home.

What callousness. What cruelty.
