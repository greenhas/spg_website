Last July, I [gave my first sermon](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/text-for-todays-toronto-congregation-sermon/) for a Community of Christ congregation, preaching on the Parable of the Samaritan. I guess I didn't do too badly, because their pastor reached out in December to ask me to give another sermon this month. On January 21st, I'll be preaching on Matthew 4:1-11, covering the Temptation of Jesus. This has been a fun passage to revisit and see with new eyes. I don't know exactly what I'm going to say just yet, but I've got plenty of notes and ideas and am looking forward to nailing things down over the next week and a half. 

Since the links for the YouTube live events are now up, I thought I'd share them in a post; at the very least, it will serve as motivation to get my act together!I'll be preaching during the regular 12pm Eastern service:

Beyond the Walls also does *Late Edition* service for people in other time zones (or with other schedules), so my sermon will be rebroadcast as part of that at 6pm Eastern:

These YouTube embeds will go live at the relevant times—and then turn into standard videos after each service is done.
