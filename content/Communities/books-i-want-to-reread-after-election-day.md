* *Walkaway*, by Cory Doctorow, because it's a story of radical hope in the face of bleak reality
* *The Bezzle*, by Cory Doctorow, because I'm going to need to keep up my frustration with self-enriching amoral tech bros
* *The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States*, by Jeffrey Lewis, because it compellingly portrays the danger of entrusting nuclear weapons in the hands of any president but especially one who is particularly petty and impulsive
* *The Plot Against America*, by Philip Roth, because it so compellingly describes the soft edges and semi-plausible deniability that American fascism would inevitably be draped in
* *Superman Smashes the Klan*, by Gene Luen Yang, because it's unapologetically pro-immigrant and anti-racism (and implicitly argues that churches should be, too)
* *Practical Anarchism: A Guide for Daily Life*, by Scott Branson, because it advocates for solving problems of care and support on our own when it's clear that the government won't do it for us
* *The Kingdom of God is Within You*, by Leo Tolstoy, because it argues for loyalty to all of humanity over loyalty to any country
* the *March* trilogy, by John Lewis, because reading it the first time made me realize that I might well have been a "surely it's not *that* bad" bystander during the Civil Rights movement, and I refuse to be that guy over the next four years

There are, of course, a number of books that I want to read for the first time in response to last night, and I probably need to prioritize those for a number of reasons. If I can find the time, though, these are the ones I want to come back to.
