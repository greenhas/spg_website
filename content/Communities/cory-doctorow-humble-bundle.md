Cory Doctorow is one of my favorite authors, and I've also (mostly) appreciated the work of Humble Bundle over the past decade. When I learned this weekend that there's an [ongoing bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/cory-doctorow-novel-collection-tor-books-books) of Doctorow's fiction, I was ecstatic. The only thing that I was disappointed about is that I've already bought so many of these titles... however, that still wasn't enough to stop me from buying all 18 items (it helps that while I own many of these already, most of the ones I own are in formats rather than epub, so now I'm a multimodal owner). As a plus, this bundle benefits the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a great organization that Doctorow has done a lot of work for.

The bundle contains a number of books that I've written about previously:

* *The Lost Cause* ([review here](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2023-11-18-ive-read/), a hopeful book about responding to the climate crisis. Not my favorite of his novels, but worth a read.
* *Red Team Blues*, a book so enjoyable that I read and reviewed it twice last year ([here](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2023-04-27-im-a/) and [here](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2023-11-01-ive-been/); also just finished [the sequel](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2024-02-25-i-feel/)). This is a great look at big tech and social inequalities—and it's really fun to read.
* *Poesy the Monster Slayer* is not a book that I've reviewed, but I definitely checked it out from the library for kiddo to read—perhaps when she was too little for it. I don't remember much of it except that it was fun.
* *Radicalized* is a collection of four amazing short stories, which I posted [about](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2019-04-27-reading-cory/) after checking it out from the library back in 2019. I use the first story, *Unauthorized Bread* to teach my students about what it means to own a digital device.
* *Walkaway* may be my favorite book of all time? It certainly was in 2023, when I read it twice. I've written enough about it that I'm just going to point you to [the aggregation page for that tag](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/tags/walkaway/) instead of linking to everything separately. I have had a quasi-religious experience with this book and plan to reread it several times over my life.
* All the books in the *Little Brother* series. I don't know if the original has held up over the years, but I [still enjoyed it](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2023-02-10-to-my/) last year. It's been a while since I read the first sequel (and I think it's my least favorite?), but *Attack Surface* is [an excellent book](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2021-10-19-just-finished/) that course corrects the series for the 2020s. I really ought to revisit that one.

There are also a lot of Doctorow books I haven't read (or haven't read in ages and have forgotten entirely about), so I think I'll get a lot of this bundle—and encourage everyone to check it out, [too](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/cory-doctorow-novel-collection-tor-books-books).
