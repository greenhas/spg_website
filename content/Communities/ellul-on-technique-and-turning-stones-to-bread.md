I have long felt that it was important to recognize that technological development does not improve human lives as much as social change does. Reading through Jacques Ellul's *Théologie et technique* (*Theology and Technique*), I liked the way that this passage (on p. 35) seemed to capture that idea: 

> La technique a enfin permis à l'homme de changer les pierres en pain. Et il est bien content. Mais il ne comprend pas pourquoi il n'est pas encore dans le Paradis après ce miracle. Il n'a aucune idée du prix qu'il a déjà payé pour y arriver.

That is:

> Technique has finally allowed man to change stones to bread. And he is very happy. But he does not understand why he is not yet in Paradise after this miracle. He has no idea what price he has already paid to get here.

I don't know that the message I'm reading from this the same thing that Ellul originally meant, but I find the metaphor really compelling, especially since it brings together religion and technique, one of the reasons that I ordered this book in particular. I hope to explore this idea more in the future.
