Last week, I [blogged about](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/two-things-that-bug-me-about-arguments-that-generative-ai-is-inevitable-or-whatever/) how the purported inevitability of generative AI gets used to sidestep moral concerns about it. Earlier this morning, I [shared a link](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/2025-04-10-this-sort/) to [a story](https://www.theverge.com/energy/646011/trump-says-the-future-of-ai-is-powered-by-coal) from The Verge that illustrates that perfectly, and so I wanted to write just a little bit more about it. 

First, let's quote some more from Jacques Ellul, whom I referenced in the last post (and whom I've just been referencing a lot in general recently). Right before the passage I quoted in last week's post—a passage from his 1980 essay *The Power of Technique and the Ethics of Non-Power*, he had this to say:

> The reality, however, is the insidious ethics of adaptation, which rests on the notion that since technique is a fact, we should adapt ourselves to it. Consequently, anything that hinders technique ought to be eliminated, and thus adaptation itself becomes a moral criterion.

It's remarkable—especially for a blurb written decades before the creation of generative AI—how well this predicts what Trump said earlier this week about increasing energy production in the U.S.: 

> “You know, we need to do the AI, all of this new technology that’s coming on line,” Trump said on Tuesday during a signing ceremony for all four executive orders. “We need more than double the energy, the electricity, that we currently have.”

We **need** to do the AI, and therefore we **need** more than double the energy. These aren't just Trump's words, either. The article from The Verge quotes Eric Schmidt—former CEO of Google—as using near identical language, and OpenAI has [used a similar argument](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/openai-urges-trump-either-settle-ai-copyright-debate-or-lose-ai-race-to-china/) to say that they **need** to be able to scrape copyrighted works if America is going to stay on top of the AI races. 

As Ellul puts it, "technique is a fact," and therefore, the rest is all a necessity. No need to ask ourselves if the cost of energy production is too high to pay, we just gotta adapt, adapt, adapt.
