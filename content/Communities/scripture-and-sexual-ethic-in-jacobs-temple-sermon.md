This is a piece that I've been meaning to write for years, but the best I've gotten is only a Twitter thread or two. A recent conversation with Elray Henriksen encouraged me to try writing my thoughts out more completely. I've toyed around with the idea of submitting it for publication, and I may yet do so in the future, but for the moment, my priority is getting it done and out there. In that same vein, I'm using a hacked-together blend of APA and Markdown footnotes for this; it's not a real citation style, but it's what came most naturally.

## Introduction

> "Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: 'For there shall not any man among you have, save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none; for I, the Lord God, delighteth in the chastity of women."

> Jacob 2:36 [LDS 2:27-28][^1]

[^1]: Throughout this essay, quotes and verse numbers from the Book of Mormon will be based on Community of Christ's 1966 *Revised Authorized Version*. This reflects my current denominational affiliation, [my belief in the value of a modern-language edition](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/tags/rereading-the-book-of-mormon-project/) of the Book of Mormon (though I personally think the RAV is too conservative in its modernization), and my agreement with a number of writers on the Book of Mormon that there is significance to the original chapter divisions of that book (which survive in Community of Christ editions but have been replaced by shorter chapters in LDS editions).

	I also regretfully use the acronym "LDS" when referencing people, teachings, and beliefs associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I would use the preferred adjective "Latter-day Saint" except for the fact that members of the RLDS Church and Community of Christ have also referred to themselves as "Latter Day Saints," and I'm not confident that all readers will pick up on the telling difference in capitalization and punctuation, undermining my abililty to distinguish between these two denominations.

Someone turning to the Book of Mormon to develop a sexual ethic would likely consult the sermon given by the Nephite prophet Jacob in the second chapter of the book bearing his name[^2]. Indeed, LDS and RLDS figures have often referred to Jacob 2 when making arguments about the nature of sexual ethics. For example, LDS apostle Mark E. Petersen[^3] quoted the above passage [in a 1969 address](https://scriptures.byu.edu/#0cf0228:t694$25858:c0cf0228) entitled *The Dangers of the So-called Sex Revolution*. Likewise, Jacob's condemnation of polygamy was a favorite resource for RLDS critics of both 19th century LDS polygamy as well as their own church's 20th century policies (and, with D&C 150, scripture) allowing polygamous men to be baptized so long as they committed to take no more wives[^4].

[^2]: Conveniently, Jacob's temple sermon appears in Jacob 2 for both LDS and Community of Christ readers.

Yet, careful readings of Jacob's temple sermon suggest that its sexual ethic is more nuanced than a generic call to chastity (or even a simple condemnation of polygamy). For example, a number of writers have found feminist themes in Jacob's sermon. Indeed, Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming[^5] describe Jacob's sermon as containing "some of the most overtly feminist messages of the Book of Mormon" (p. 111). Carol Lynn Pearson[^6] points to the polygamous husbands of this passage as one piece of evidence (among many others) of an "anti-female bias evident among the Nephites" that may have been "one of the numerous causes of their downfall" (p. 223). Similarly, Deidre Nicole Green[^7] interprets "Jacob's references to women's chastity" as a reference "to women's sexual agency" (p. 88).  These readings invite us to see Jacob's sexual ethic as the outgrowth of a deeper commitment to gender equality rather than a self-evident list of sexual prohibitions.

Inspired by these kinds of readings, my goal in this essay is to offer further nuance to Jacob's temple sermon and to ask how that nuance might inform the sexual ethic that individuals and denominations that read the Book of Mormon draw from it. I will begin by describing the inherent subjectivity involved in the interpretation of scripture. This is important for making clear the perspective *I bring* to reading the Book of Mormon. Perhaps more importantly, it also sets the stage for my first argument: that to understand Jacob's sexual ethic, we must first understand *Jacob's own* approach to scripture. Finally, I will place Jacob's sexual ethic within his approach to scripture and comment on how this placement may affect how Jacob 2 is interpreted today.

## On Scripture and Subjectivity

In this section, I argue that the interpretation of scripture is an inherently subjective process—but that some interpretations are better than others. I conclude by acknowledging the subjectivity that I bring to the Book of Mormon text.

### Subjective Scripture

There is no such thing as an objective interpretation of scripture. To illustrate this point, consider the case of Enoch's vision, composed by Joseph Smith Jr. and recorded in D&C 36 by Community of Christ and Moses 7 by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This passage contains a reference to God weeping, an idea that (at least in LDS circles) has captured a fair amount of attention in recent years[^8]. However, as RLDS historian emeritus Richard Howard has noted[^9],  D&C 36 (and, thus, Moses 7[^10]) is based on an 1867 RLDS committee's efforts to bring together two different drafts of this vision composed by Joseph Smith Jr. throughout his lifetime. In the later of the two drafts, Joseph replaced the reference to *God* weeping with a reference to *Enoch* weeping. By Joseph's murder in 1844, he had not fully completed his revision of the Bible, leaving a number of ambiguities and contradictions for the 1867 RLDS committee to do their best to resolve.

[^8]: See, for example:

	Givens, T. L., & Givens, F. (2012). *The God who weeps: How Mormonism makes sense of life*. Ensign Peak.
	
[^9]: Howard, R. P. (1995). *Restoration scriptures: A study of their textual development*. Herald Publishing House

[^10]: This article from the LDS periodical *The Ensign* concludes that the text of the Book of Moses found in the Pearl of Great Price was taken from the RLDS-printed Inspired Version of the Bible:

	Matthews, R. J. (1986, January). How we got the Book of Moses. *The Ensign*. https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1986/01/how-we-got-the-book-of-moses?lang=eng

Thus, when LDS prophet-president Russell Nelson referenced God's weeping in this vision as part of an April 2019 sermon[^11] asserting the necessity of certain sacraments[^12], this was not necessarily the straightforward prooftext he may have been hoping for. Rather, Nelson was referencing a version of this passage of scripture that was cobbled together by: 

1. a committee of individuals (who may have disagreed among themselves),
2. who did not share Nelson's faith (and could have brought RLDS biases into their decisions),
3. who were faced with contradictory versions of the passage (making it difficult to know what Joseph Smith Jr. intended), and
4. who made the curious decision to prioritize the earlier draft of the passage (as opposed to the later draft, which appears to be an intentional revision)

If there is this level of subjectivity involved in the *production* of scripture[^13], how much more subjectivity should we expect in the *interpretation* of scripture? If it is next to impossible to say what the authoritative version of Enoch's vision is, it must be outright impossible to limit ourselves to a single, objective interpretation of the same vision.

[^11]: Nelson, R. M. (2019, April). "'Come, Follow Me.'" https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/46nelson

[^12]: I use the Community of Christ (and broader Christian) terminology of "sacraments" for what members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints more commonly refer to as "ordinances."

[^13]: The subjectivity involved in this example is particularly noteworthy given the way that members of Restoration denominations have frequently praised the scripture that Joseph Smith, Jr. has produced as more trustworthy than, say, the Bible. 

### Productive Constraints

Although the interpretation of scripture is inherently subjective, our interpretations can be stronger when we impose productive constraints on them. Some of these constraints take the form of theological commitments. For example, the Community of Christ Statement on Scripture[^14] encourages members of this denomination to interpret scripture through a Christ-focused lens with statements like "It is to Christ that scripture points" and "It is Christ whom we must hear" (Affirmation One). Furthermore, Community of Christ believes that scripture must be read through a particular understanding of Christ: "Scripture’s authority is derived from the model of Christ, who came to be a servant (Mark 10:45). Therefore, the authority of scripture is not the authority to oppress, control, or dominate" (Affirmation Four). Although there are passages of scripture that are seemingly unrelated to Christ—or that seem to promote oppression, control, or domination—a member of Community of Christ might craft their interpretation of (or response to) those passages based primarily on those theological commitments.

[^14]: This statement can be accessed at https://cofchrist.org/scripture/

Yet, it is also productive to recognize the ways in which scripture may not conform with our theological commitments. In particular, scholarly observations related to language, history, and archaeology may also constrain our interpretation. For example, Matthew 1:22-23 describes Isaiah 7:14 as prophecy of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ; although the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible referenced by the author of this Gospel *does* use the word "virgin," the Hebrew Bible itself uses a word meaning "young woman"—not the word that the Hebrew Bible uses to indicate virginity[^15]. This need not prevent Christians from holding to the doctrine of Jesus's virgin birth, but it should constrain them from insisting that Jewish readers, for example, read Isaiah through a Christ-focused lens. Similarly, Thomas Wayment's translation of the New Testament[^16] respectfully notes that distinctly LDS interpretations of specific New Testament verses are often dependent on the exact words of the King James Version of the Bible and do not hold up to more accurate translations of the original Greek. Once again, there is (usually) no harm in adopting those interpretations, but there is little room for imposing those interpretations on others.

### Personal Perspective

The subjectivity of scripture interpretation and the productive constraints we impose on our own interpretations will become important later in this essay, as we consider how Jacob approaches scripture (and how that affects his sexual ethic). However, they also highlight the importance of acknowledging the subjectivity that I bring to this essay.

I write from the perspective of someone who long practiced in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but who now practices in Community of Christ. Thus, I am familiar with and sympathetic to LDS approaches to the Book of Mormon. Furthermore, there is no getting around the fact that there has been more writing on the Book of Mormon (especially in recent years) from LDS perspectives than from RLDS/Community of Christ perspectives; I have not read all of the interesting writing on the Book of Mormon, but my thinking is largely shaped by LDS writers (if not institutional perspectives). That said, my core theological commitments are presently closer to Community of Christ than they are to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Especially relevant here is my firm belief in what prophet-president Stephen Veazey expressed in D&C 163:7[^17] (which resembles my previous references to the Community of Christ Statement on Scripture): 

> 7 a. Scripture is an indispensable witness to the Eternal Source of light and truth, which cannot be fully contained in any finite vessel or language. Scripture has been written and shaped by human authors through experiences of revelation and ongoing inspiration of the Holy Spirit in the midst of time and culture.
>
> b. Scripture is not to be worshiped or idolized. Only God, the Eternal One of whom scripture testifies, is worthy of worship. God’s nature, as revealed in Jesus Christ and affirmed by the Holy Spirit, provides the ultimate standard by which any portion of scripture should be interpreted and applied.
> 
> c. It is not pleasing to God when any passage of scripture is used to diminish or oppress races, genders, or classes of human beings. Much physical and emotional violence has been done to some of God’s beloved children through the misuse of scripture. The church is called to confess and repent of such attitudes and practices.

In terms of the productive constraints I bring to bear on the Book of Mormon, I am doubtful of the Book of Mormon's historicity in the same way I am doubtful of the historicity of much of the Hebrew Bible[^18]. Furthermore, even when I did believe that Nephites and Lamanites really existed, I likely would have agreed with Bruce Lindgren's[^19] observation that despite many efforts to the contrary, we simply do not have access to the purported original language of the Book of Mormon or to any conclusive historical or archaeological data related to its narrative—the very context that is necessary for responsible interpretation of scripture.

[^18]: That is, what Christians have typically referred to as the Old Testament.

[^19]: Lindgren, A. B. (1986). Sign or scripture: Approaches to the Book of Mormon. *Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought*, *19*(1), 69-75. 

Despite these obstacles, I strongly believe the Book of Mormon—like the Hebrew Bible—has much to teach us and is therefore valuable as scripture. To borrow a phrase often applied to the Bible, I take the Book of Mormon seriously but not literally. Indeed, Lindgren[^19] argues that:

> The most significant threat to the Book of Mormon... is not questions of its historicity. The most significant threat is that it will be ignored by the faithful. If we refuse to ask questions and listen to its responses, we will have an artifact which has no scriptural function despite our reverence for it. (p. 74)

I believe that we can ask questions of the Book of Mormon and that it will provide responses. Like Lindgren[^19], I expect that "we will find ourselves arguing with the book's answers much of the time" (p. 75)[^20], but I have also found that careful reading of the Book of Mormon often provides answers that inform my faith. In particular, Grant Hardy[^21] has provided an important model for my reading of the Book of Mormon: one that focuses primarily on what the text has to say about religion (rather than anything that it "proves" or "disproves" about religion), one that treats the narrators as real people (without going so far as to say they were historical figures), and reads between the lines to consider whether there is a story behind the story. This is not the only way of approaching the Book of Mormon productively[^22], and it is not without its downsides[^23], but it is my preferred approach and the perspective I bring to this essay.

[^20]: Lindgren notes that this should be expected, considering how often scripture argues **with itself** (providing examples of disputes between Paul and James in the New Testament and between the authors of Jonah and Ezra-Nehemiah in the Hebrew Bible)

[^21]: Hardy, G. (2010). *Understanding the Book of Mormon: A reader's guide*. Oxford University Press.

[^22]: For example, some authors have suggested that we use the 19th century American context of the Book of Mormon's emergence—including associated history and language—to guide our reading. Here are two models of that approach that I find helpful.

	Luffman, D. E. (2013). *The Book of Mormon's witness to its first readers*. Community of Christ Seminary Press.
	
	McClellan, D. O. (2020). 2 Nephi 25:23 in literary and rhetorical context. *Journal of Book of Mormon Studies*, *29*, 1-19. 
	
	It is also noteworthy that neither of these authors argues that using 19th-century contexts necessarily means rejecting the purported origins of the Book of Mormon. After all, the text itself suggests that it is meant for a 19th-century American audience, and as readers of the Book of Mormon resemble that audience less and less, there is value in understanding how its "first readers" would have received its message.
	
[^23]: In my view, the most important downside of taking the Book of Mormon text seriously while bracketing its claims to historicity is the way that the text imposes an identity and history on indigenous peoples of the Americas. A narrative approach to the Book of Mormon **can** offer interesting, more nuanced readings of the text's approach to indigenous peoples, as evidenced by:
	
	Hickman, J. (2014). The Book of Mormon as Amerindian apocalypse. *American Literature*, *86*(3), 429-461. https://doi.org/10.1215/00029831-2717371
	
	However, I've also heard Hickman acknowledge that *if* the Book of Mormon provides a path to postcolonialism, it is at best a "janky bridge" at risk of collapse. In that same conference presentation, he also argued that it is ultimately up to indigenous readers to decide whether his reading is appropriate.
	
	Thus, while this narrative perspective can change how we understand what the Book of Mormon says about indigenous peoples of the Americas, it does not respond to the fact that the Book of Mormon **does** say something about indigenous peoples that purports to overwrite those peoples' own identities and histories.

## Jacob's Temple Sermon is About Interpreting Scripture

> "For, behold, thus says the Lord, 'This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures; for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms because of the things which were written concerning David and Solomon his son.'"

> Jacob 2:32 [LDS 2:23]

Discussing the interpretation of scripture is an important first step for this essay because Jacob begins the portion of his sermon addressing sexual ethics by accusing his audience of misinterpreting scripture. Likewise, he tries to correct this misinterpretation *before* he proposes a sexual ethic. Yes, Jacob is talking about sex, but it's clear that scripture is also on his mind.

However, this observation is complicated by the fact Jacob's audience actually has more of scripture on its side than Jacob himself does. In the following sections, I will discuss where Jacob appears to get things wrong—but what that tells us about his approach to scripture.

### Jacob is Wrong...

In their treatment of this portion of Jacob's temple sermon, Fatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming[^5], describe Jacob as explaining:

> what is even worse than what went before [i.e., Jacob's critique of seeking for wealth and oppressing the poor]: the Nephites are manipulating scripture to excuse their own selfish behavior. They are weaponizing holy text in order to justify committing evil. (p. 110)

In broad terms, I agree with this argument; however, I would not describe the Nephite men as "manipulating scripture" to justify the taking of concubines and additional wives. Indeed, Wil Gafney[^24] writes that after Lamech takes two wives in Genesis 4:19:

> From this point forward in the Scriptures, Lamech-style partnership (polygamy), rather than Eve/Adam-style monogamy, becomes normative. (p. 28)

At best, Gafney continues, God is silent on the subject of polygamy. Despite Jacob's insistence that God condemns the Nephite men's misinterpretation of scripture, commands monogamy as a general rule[^25], and that David and Solomon's polygamy was an abomination[^26] 

[^24]: Gafney, W. C. (2017) *Womanist midrash: A reintroduction to the women of the Torah and the throne*. Westminster John Knox Press.

[^25]: Jacob 2:39 [LDS 2:30] suggests that God can authorize polygamy in specific caases, but without explicit instructions, believers should stick to monogamy. 

[^26]: This particular rhetorical flourish poses a particular dilemma for LDS readers of the Book of Mormon. Critics of LDS polygamy have often noted the irony that Jacob's anti-polygamy screed appears in the faith's founding text; however, whereas Jacob leaves open the possibility of God-ordained polygamy, he is very clear that David and Solomon's actions were abominable. However, D&C 132 (for perhaps obvious reasons, there is no Community of Christ equivalent to this passage)

While Jacob specifically critiques these men's reference of biblical passages related to David and Solomon, there are many others 

Rather, Nephite men 


 misleading , but I think it's misleading to describe 

I'm also not sure that scripture needs much manipulation to excuse the Nephite men's behavior in this case. 

### ...But Is Jacob Right?
