Next Sunday, I'll be giving the sermon for the Community of Christ Toronto Congregation's *Beyond the Walls* inclusive online congregation, speaking on the Parable of the Samaritan (more often called the Parable of the Good Samaritan, but my sermon will explain why I'm going for that name instead). I had been planning to post about the sermon after the fact, but the links for the YouTube live events went up today, so I thought I might share them ahead of time. 

I'll be preaching during the regular 12pm Eastern service:

Beyond the Walls has also started doing a *Late Edition* service for people in other time zones (or with other schedules), so my sermon will be rebroadcast as part of that at 6pm Eastern:

These YouTube embeds will go live at the relevant times—and then turn into standard videos after each service is done. 

I've participated in a [previous Beyond the Walls service](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/communities/participation-in-june-12th-beyond-the-walls-online-service/) by submitting a prerecorded prayer, but this is the first time I've ever participated live with them. It's also the first time I've ever given a sermon in a Community of Christ setting. I participate fairly regularly in my home congregation's services—the late, great Dave Blair got me involved participating in Zoom services within six weeks of my starting to attend regularly during the COVID-19 pandemic—but my congregation seems to stick to ordained folks when it comes to sermons. I have no issue with that (or with not being ordained—it's nice to just be someone in the pews (or, more often, on Zoom) after two decades of serving as part of the LDS priesthood), but it means I'm a bit out of practice when it comes to preparing a message for a Sunday service. Here's hoping it goes well!
