I once had a neighbor who argued that because it had higher fidelity, 3-D was the future of cinema. To prove his point, he asked “who would prefer an audio adaptation to a video one?” and was surprised when I, a big radio fan, raised my hand. To be honest, I don’t know that I’d prefer radio to TV/cinema in *every* instance, but I believe firmly that it’s more about how you use a medium than it is about what medium you use. Dangerous to think one is inherently better than another.
