Interesting story about efforts to write a story about the greater Geneva area that transcends national bordersâ€”and the projectâ€™s difficulty of transcending national borders. Reminds me of the time I was driving through Meyrin, took a wrong turn, and accidentally wound up in Franceâ€”or when I would get from one side of the canton to the other during the awful rush hour by leaving Switzerland and taking a French autoroute around. Cities like Geneva really challenge the idea of borders.
