I probably would not have read this book on my own but it was selected as the 2022 Kentucky Reads selection by Kentucky Humanities. I noticed that in a headline somewhere (probably the Herald-Leader) and decided it was worth giving it a shot.

I ended up enjoying the book a lot! It plays with themes of nostalgia and wondering if the past could have or should have been different. I've been thinking about both of those things a lot recently, including in the context of my faith transition. Mason's Ann tries to imagine a past that would have been different but is unable to depart from the past that actually was, and for all my question about my own past, I know it's the past I have, and I don't mind it.
