Wolk read 27,000+ Marvel comics to write this book, an attempt to trace the most important part of the Marvel universe over the past ~60 years.

I love the book for a few reasons. First, it takes comics‚Äîand Marvel Comics in particular‚Äîseriously, examining their sense-making and stories. Second, there's a deep love of comics that's evident in the book. Not a stilted, defensive love, but a mature one that knows what's wrong with them but champions what they get right.

I came away from the book with a deeper appreciation for these comics and a few series to try!
