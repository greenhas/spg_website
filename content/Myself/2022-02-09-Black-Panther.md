I don't think I've ever read any Black Panther before, but I loved the movie from a few years ago, and Christopher Priest's run was recommended in *All of the Marvels*, so I decided to give this a try.

I see why this run was recommended, and there was a lot in there to like, but at the end of the day, I'm not sure it worked for me. I enjoy comics a lot, but it felt really continuity-heavy, and maybe I prefer graphic novels and self-contained short runs to issues that try to sit in the middle of everything Marvel's ever published.

I'm also used to more modern comics, and the 90s take on Marvel characters I know (say Thor or Iron Man) wasn't as much fun as some of the other takes I've known.
