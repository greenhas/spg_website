I think this might be the best of the series so far, even if it's not quite good enough to bump it up to four hearts.

First, this is probably the most serious consideration of the far right conspiracy in the series as a violent, racist conspiracy and not just a plot point.

Second, while it's as chock-full of references to other characters and events in the series as previous volumes, I feel like this volume does a better job than any of the others of trying to weave them together into a coherent whole rather than simply stuff references into a volume. 

It's still not great, but I enjoyed and appreciated it more than the others.
