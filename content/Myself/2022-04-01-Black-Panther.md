I've owned this comic for a while and have been meaning to read it the whole time‚Äîespecially since reading *All of the Marvels* and the first volume of Christopher Priest's run on Black Panther.

Anyway, I finally got to it and I mostly liked it, but it wasn't as mind-blowing as I hoped it would be. Coates does some really interesting things challenging the idea of Black Panther as an ideal monarch by questioning if such a thing even exists.

I still felt like I was kept from enjoying it by some of the weak parts of the comics medium. There was a bit of continuity lockout, and it seemed to move slowly from issue to issue.

I'd consider reading the second TPB to see where things go from here, but I was hoping for more, I guess.
