I found this translation of Delisle's latest graphic novel at the Jessamine County Public Library and decided to give it a try. I don't remember how I discovered Delisle, but I love his book *Pyongyang*, I've read a couple of his other books, and I loved this one. 

Delisle's art is great‚Äîhis style is consistent, simple, and appealing. I like the way that he did color in this book, which is mostly monochrome but with bursts of yellow here and there.

Delisle also tells a great story about summer jobs and growing up. I never worked in a pulp and paper factory, but I have worked this kind of job and had similar experiences, so this really resonated with me. It's clear that Delisle is drawing on memories that stuck with him. 

I'd give this five hearts, but it bums me out to read the English translation. Delisle has a great use of language, and I kept finding myself wondering what he actually wrote.
