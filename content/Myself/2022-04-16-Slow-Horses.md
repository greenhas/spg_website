My spouse and I recently started watching the Apple TV+ series based on this book and its sequels. I've loved the show, so when she and kiddo were at a local library on Thursday, they grabbed the book for me. 

I'm a big fan of John Le Carr√©, and this feels like a worthy modern successor. It's crafty and smart, but even more than Le Carr√©, Herron leans into the ugly parts of the profession and the people who embrace those parts rather than try to maintain honor and dignity.

As much as I loved the book, I might be enjoying the series better. The actors are great and lend more personality to the characters than the book did. That said, I plan to continue reading the series‚ÄîI even stopped midway through this review to check out the second book on Libby, an ebook library app.
