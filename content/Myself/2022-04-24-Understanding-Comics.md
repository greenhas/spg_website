I've wanted to read this book before—I believe I read the whole thing once in high school, and we read a portion of it in a French Civ class before discussing the Bayeux Tapestry. I recently saw it at the library and decided to give it another go.

Because I took a while to get started, the due date snuck up on me, and I had to rush through most of it rather than give it the critical read it deserves.

Nonetheless, I appreciate the book deeply for the way it shows how much depth there is in comics despite popular conception of them as "low" media. It renewed my interest in the genre and made me want to learn more about it from a technical perspective.
