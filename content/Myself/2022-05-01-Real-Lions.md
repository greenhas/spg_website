Even though I ought to be finishing up some other books, I've enjoyed this series enough to check out the third book and read it over the last few days.

Herron does a good job of making none of his characters likable but some of sympathetic and I enjoyed this book more than the last. Herron does his best, I think, when his nominal heroes and their bosses are the real villains of the piece.

There's plenty to think about in terms of the real world, too, and this is another reason I enjoyed this book more than the last. Dead Lions was grounded but still felt more cinematic than the first and third books in the series.
