We took a family trip to Mammoth Cave this weekend, and I decided to read the fourth entry in this series over the course of the trip. I quite liked it and it was fun to read it so quickly.

Despite being a bit more fantastical and less down to earth than some of the other entries, I thought the story was innovative and made good use of some of the recurring characters of the series so far.

The cynicism of the series felt like it really stepped up in this volume, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Even more than Le Carr√©, Herron is willing to treat the spy trade as less heroic than readers are used to getting in fiction.
