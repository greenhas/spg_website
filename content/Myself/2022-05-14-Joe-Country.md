I flew through this book and quite enjoyed it. As Herron gets further along in the series, the continued plots strain suspension strain suspension of disbelief more and more, just like Smiley's repeated resignations and returns make some of Le Carré's books a bit creaky.

Like Le Carré, though, there's enough that's good about the series that you can overlook these gaps. Herron feels no need to spare his characters, and he uses that expertly in this book. Many of his books include teasing (even trolling) suggestions that something is about to happen to an established character, but this book begins with a flash forward to two characters' deaths, and the rest of the book is quite tense as you wonder what Herron is going to do to lead to that conclusion.
