This book has been as enjoyable as all of the previous ones in the series. It took me longer to get into‚Äîprobably because I've read so many of them lately‚Äîbut once I got started, it moved along nicely.

The past few entries in the series have seemed more intentional than others in setting up clues for the future rather than being self-contained stories. This book was also shorter and ended on a dramatic cliffhanger, giving the impression that Herron is wrapping up the series in the next book and might even have split this final story into two. 

That's not necessarily a complaint, though. I'm excited to read the next book, but as it's just come out, it might take a while before I can get my hands on a library copy.
