I recently finished the new Squirrel Girl podcast written by North, which made me miss the comics. I've also been meaning to finish the series, which ended in 2019 but I never caught up on. 

So, I checked on the hoopla app connected to my library account and discovered that the whole series is finally available there—hooray!

I own all of these issues in trade paperback, but I read them on my phone to give me something productive to do on my phone. I've read these issues tons of times—or at least several—but it was still great to revisit the characters I love and North's absurd humor accompanied with Henderson's distinct art style.
