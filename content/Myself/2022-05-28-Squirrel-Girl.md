I'm less familiar with this part of the Squirrel Girl series, so it was even more fun to revisit these issues as I try to make my way through the whole series.

North is a great author for this kind of thing‚ÄîI get a bit grumpy about his computer science lessons because of my complicated feelings toward computer science education (I'm for it but not necessarily in the way it's being done) , but otherwise, I love his dialogue, characters, plots, and absurdity. 

I think North does a good job of capturing what I like about webcomics, which makes sense given his pioneering role with Dinosaur Comics.
