As with the last collection of TUSG issues, I have read these stories before, but not recently and not often, so it was fun to revisit them. 

After finishing this collection, I had to go back to the regular TPBs rather than this double TPB format, and that's made me better appreciate these large formats, which leave out things like the letters page, etc. I have enjoyed reading those before, but when trying to power through the entire series, it's nice to remove extraneous information and focus on the stuff I'm really there to read.

Beyond that, it's hard to say what else I appreciated in particular about this collection‚ÄîNorth and his collaborators continue to have lots of fun with the character and with comics in general.
