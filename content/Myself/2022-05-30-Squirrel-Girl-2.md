This is another collection that I think I've read once but didn't remember terribly well and was happy to return to it. I don't know if I've read the next collection or not‚Äîit will be interesting to see when I begin to venture into the unknown. 

I think this TPB has one of the most creative and sweetest stories in the whole run‚Äîone about the friendship between Doreen and her roommate Nancy. It also has some of the most explicit arguments for radical empathy in a series that makes that one of its main themes. All, of course, wrapped up in a lot of goofball humor and great art.
