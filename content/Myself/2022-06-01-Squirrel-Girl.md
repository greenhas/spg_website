Beginning with this collection, the art changes, which I was sure would be an issue for me (no pun intended). I really like Erica Henderson's drawing, and I think it fits North's writing better, so I knew I would miss it.

However, this TPB also has one of the best stories of the run in it‚Äîone that I'd forgotten all about. North really wrestles with his recurring theme of redemption rather than punishment with a multi-issue story on Kraven the Hunter‚Äîbut still writes it in a way that affirms hope in the power of redemption.

I'm also noticing on this readthrough how much more I appreciate the nihilistic cyborg Brain Drain than in previous readings of this series. He struck me as a funny joke before, but as my existential dread has grown over the past few years, I find the character relatable but hopeful.
