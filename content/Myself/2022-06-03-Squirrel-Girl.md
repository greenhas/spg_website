I feel pretty confident that this is the last of the TPBs that I've previously read. When first starting it, I thought that I hadn't read it before, but it became familiar pretty quickly. 

I still miss Henderson's art, but the series continue to be good! North has good ideas, Brain Drain is inspiring in a funny and goofy kind of way, and Squirrel Girl continue to represent intelligence and empathy.
