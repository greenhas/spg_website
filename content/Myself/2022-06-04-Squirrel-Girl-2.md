This, the final arc in the TUSG book, was a delightful way to wrap up the series. It captured all the stories, characters, art, and ideas that made this comic so great and gave them the ending that they deserved. 

There were a lot of callbacks to previous parts of the series, and it could have been annoying, but I found it to be a nice way of wrapping everything up. 

Having read the series after listening to the recent TUSG podcast, I can see how this finale set up the premise of the podcast‚Äîthe ending note of the comic was a great way to wrap things up while leaving the door open for new media.
