This is, in my view, the weakest arc in all of North's run on Squirrel Girl, and I think it's because it's the only time that North's story gets a significant connecting to an overarching Marvel plot. It's not bad—the characters and art are still interesting in the ways that previous stories have been—but I just didn't feel as engaged by any of it as I had been in previous TPBs.

On the plus side, this was finally brand new territory for me, and it was nice to visit some stories that I hadn't previously read.
