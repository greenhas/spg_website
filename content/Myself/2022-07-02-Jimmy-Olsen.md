I never would have picked this comic up on my own, but I discovered it through TVTropes, read it over two days, and really enjoyed i! 

Fraction's take on writing it is similar to Ryan North's take on Squirrel Girl, with a lot of humor, very little taking oneself seriously, and plenty of story to keep the whole thing together.

The comic leans into the silliness of Olsen as a character and embraces a lot of the Silver Age approach to comics. It homages that era in a way that acknowledges its silliness, and that self-aware approach is ‚Äîsurprisingly!‚Äîbetter than any attempt to reimagine or grittify the character.
