I am not entirely sure why I decided to finally read this book. I say "finally," but the truth is that it's never been on my list of books to read. I certainly never had plans to watch the movie, but maybe that was what pushed me to read the book. After hearing os much about a classic movie that I didn't think I'd ever watch, I figured I ought to at least read the book. 

I understand why the book is a classic. It's compelling and inviting, the characters are terrible but charismatic, and despite so many layers to the story, they all work together nicely and create an interesting whole.

The only thing I can complain about is the lifting up of gangsters as semi-admirable characters. It makes for a great book but a lousy worldview.
