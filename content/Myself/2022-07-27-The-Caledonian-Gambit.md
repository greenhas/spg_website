I read this book for the first time a few years ago. Dan is a regular panelist on The Incomparable and a regular player on their D+D spinoff, so I figured I owed it a read. When reading it then, it bounced off of me—I wasn't all that impressed with the story or the writing, and I barely remembered any of it when revisiting it.

I recently listened to Dan talk about this book—and the sequels he's since written—on an episode of The Incomparable, so I decided to give the series another try. It's not a masterpiece of science fiction, but I liked the setting and the writing wasn't terrible. I don't know what made the difference this time, but I've already reserved the next one from the library.
