I saw this book at a bookstore on a recent family vacation and immediately made note of it. I'd read Robb's *The Discovery of France* in college and really enjoyed it, so I was sure I'd like this one, too.

I checked it out from the library and then had to read it in a rush when I was alerted about someone else's hold on the book. I ended up turning it in about a week late, but oh well.

Despite my optimism, I really struggled with the book. My Francophilia doesn't extend terribly far back in time. I had trouble staying interested and keeping details from the earlier chapters (even if it was nice to learn about the Gauls more deeply than through Ast√©rix).

The second half of the book got much more interesting, though. I appreciated Robb's mix of memoir, scholarship, and editorializing. I may have to reread *The Discovery of France* and see how it holds up!
