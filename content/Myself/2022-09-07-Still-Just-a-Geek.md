I picked this book up on a whim at a Nashville bookstore over the summer. It surprised me that I felt drawn to the book‚ÄîI know who Wheaton is, but I'm not a super fan; the book was an expensive new hardback; and I usually am more hesitant about buying things than grabbing something on a whim. 

I did really feel drawn to the book, though. I had recently started reading Wheaton's blog, I admire his EFF-style thinking, I know he's been an advocate for mental health, and I was intrigued by the conceit of revisiting a 20-year-old memoir and annotating it with two decades of further growth and hindsight.

These last two things are what made the book worth it. There are bits I disagreed with or didn't like, but I loved seeing the multiple layers of growth and reflection in the book, and the messages about mental health really spoke to me.
