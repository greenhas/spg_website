I find myself enjoying this books as quick reads in between‚Äîor concurrent with‚Äîlonger, more demanding reads. It's interesting to see Moren build up more of his fictional universe and do more work to connect characters and events.

I enjoyed the actions and setting of this book‚Äîit would make good inspiration for an RPG setting, which I mean as a compliment. It felt like the cliffhanger in this book was a bit of a gimmick, and I'm not sure I followed all of the plot (or that it was developed in the way I would have hoped), but it was still an enjoyable read.
