I've been looking forward to this since the first season ended. Midway through watching the first season, I'd already begun reading the series, and I may have already finished the second book by the time I saw the trailer for the second series. This season did a great job at making use of the source material while changing and improving things as needed. It's a fun book series, but I think it's shaping up to be a better show.
