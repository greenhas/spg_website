What a beautiful book! Krug's story of exploring both what it means to be German and her family's connection to Nazism is moving, and her multimodal approach‚Äîcombining text, photos, and drawings‚Äîreally helps the story come alive. It was sometimes hard to follow all the names and threads, but that's largely my own fault. I'd been meaning to read this for a while and was pleased to randomly find it on a library shelf.
