I've read this a couple times before, so I knew it wouldn't be great, but it was on sale for a dollar at a used book store, and I have a soft spot for it (including its sequels), so I picked it up and gave it another go. I think this retelling makes big mistakes about Superman (believing that destructive fights and interstellar intrigue are what makes the character interesting) and about origin story retellings (gesturing to the reader and including shocking plot twists), but it also asks the important questions about power and responsibility that make Superman stories good. Likewise, while a young and somewhat edgy Clark Kent gets on my nerves, it is an interesting way of exploring the character as he might be as a twenty-something beginner.
