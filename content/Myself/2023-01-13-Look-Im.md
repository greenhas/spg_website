Look, I'm not a cinema connoisseur, and I'm sure this doesn't hold up in ways that I don't know. Conversely, I appreciate Weird Al, but I'm not the kind of megafan that would pick up on every joke. All I know is that this movie is delightful for the way it just leans into the absurdity and doesn't apologize for it. I loved it, and even the dumbest parts made it better.
