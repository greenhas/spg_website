Reading an actual Apple terms of service document can only be so interesting, but at least creating a graphic novel version helps. The sheer audacity of the project is most of why I liked this comic, but it's also quite fun to see Sikoryak's homages to different comics, always with a Jobsian twist. It's weird, and I don't see myself rereading it, but I think it's great.
