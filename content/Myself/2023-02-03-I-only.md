I only learned about The Sandbaggers last weekend, on an episode of The Incomparable, but I watched the entire first series this week‚Äîand loved it. It isn't perfect: There's too much 1970s casual misogyny for it to be self-critical in the same way that a modern show set in the 70s would be, and the brown face in one episode is also embarassing. Not setting those aside, I was still impressed with the way the show combined the bumbling hypocrisy of Yes, Minister; the self-serving internal politics of Slow Horses; and the cynical despair of Le Carr√© into a single, compelling show.
