I haven't read this in over a decade, so I recently decided to listen to an audiobook version and see how I liked it this time through. The overall story is excellent! I found particularly compelling the question of scientific (and technological) responsibility, and the creature's railing against his creator at Chamonix in the middle of the book struck me as almost Job-like. I wasn't expecting the Chamonix scene to resonate with me as much as the tech allegory, but it will also stay with me, I think. Maybe it's my modern reader's eyes (or general familiarity with the book, but I found that this time, I didn't have a lot of patience for some of the extended expressions of melancholy or the "travelogue" aspects of the book. I also found the nested epistolary structure to sometimes strain my suspension of disbelief. That said, those are ultimately minor complaints!
