I read this when Wil first published it, but I thought of it again today with even more gratitude—for both Wil and Senator Fetterman. I've been wondering recently whether I should refrain from making particular commitments or pursuits because of my own struggles with mental health, and knowing that there's someone with depression serving in the U.S. Senate is giving me hope.
