Burnside got less and less likeable as the show went on (though this might be the point!), and I got tired of how many plots boiled down to "Burnside doesn't care and goes rogue." I was also disappointed that what could have been an interesting series-long subplot about a strained relationship between Burnside and Ross went nowhere. If I revisit this show again in the future, I'll stop after the first series.
