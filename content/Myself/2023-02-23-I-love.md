I love the premise and the characters of this show, but it felt like it was running out of steam by the third series (though I'll admit I don't know how much the mysterious disappearance of its creator had to do with this—I'd like to read the book on the subject). Burnside got less and less likeable as the show went on (though this might be the point!), and I got tired of how many plots boiled down to "Burnside doesn't care and goes rogue." I was also disappointed that what could have been an interesting series-long subplot about a strained relationship between Burnside and Ross went nowhere. If I revisit this show again in the future, I'll stop after the first series.
