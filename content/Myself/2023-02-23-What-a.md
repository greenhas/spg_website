I started this right after finishing Doctorow's *Little Brother* because it's recommended in the supplementary materials. It's a bit odd to read in 2023: The idea of cryptocurrency has been tainted with recent news, it spectacularly fails the Bechdel test, and it seems to me to use more casual racial slurs than the chapters in the Pacific Theater might allow for in the name of realism. Yet, it's intricately plotted, well written, just absurd enough to make it better, and technical without being overwhelming. I don't know that I'll ever read it again, but I think it's deserving of its reputation.
