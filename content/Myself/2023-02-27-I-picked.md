I picked this up after hearing about it in the show notes of an EFF podcast the author appeared on. This is not the book that I expected to read, I'm not sure I entirely got it, and it even feels a bit like a shaggy dog story at the end. I still enjoyed it, though, in a way I can't quite put my finger on. It's neat to read fiction from deliberately African perspectives, the shaggy dog-ness is probably the point, and the characters are compelling. I'm looking forward to trying the sequel.
