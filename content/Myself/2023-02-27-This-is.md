This is my third time reading this book‚ÄîI couldn't resist coming back to it for the "epistolary novel" square of my library's "Books and Bites Bingo" challenge this year. The print book is amazing, the audiobook manages to adapt a book that shouldn't be adaptable, and I enjoyed this read as much as the last two. The language and worldbuilding are subtle but effective, it's morally complex without trying too hard to be, and the characters are a good mix between believable and, well, archetypal characters in a YA novel.
