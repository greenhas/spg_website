I gave Saga a try a few years ago, but it didn't quite work for me (or my prudishness), so as good of a reputation it had, I didn't stick with it. I just got the first ten volumes through a Humble Bundle, though, and so it's time to give it another try. I'm no longer bothered by swearing and sex like I was a decade (or whatever) ago, though I'll admit that casual gore is not something that endears me to comics. I don't know if I think this is the best comic ever, but I can tell why it's beloved, and I'm excited to keep reading. The art is great, the characters are compelling, it's delightfully weird, and I enjoy the use of Esperanto as an alien language. Looking forward to the next volume!
