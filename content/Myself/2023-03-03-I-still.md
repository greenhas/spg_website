Vaughan is blending together characters and plot threads in interesting and new ways, and I'm eager to see where he goes with it. This didn't get as high as a review from me as the last volume, though. Maybe it's because there was some more of the gore that's my least favorite part of this, or maybe it's because I don't like media about couples going through rough patches, even if it's well done.
