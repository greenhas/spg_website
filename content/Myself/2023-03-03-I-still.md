I still love so much about this series and am looking forward to continuing it. Vaughan is blending together characters and plot threads in interesting and new ways, and I'm eager to see where he goes with it. This didn't get as high as a review from me as the last volume, though. Maybe it's because there was some more of the gore that's my least favorite part of this, or maybe it's because I don't like media about couples going through rough patches, even if it's well done.
