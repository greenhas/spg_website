You know, I still feel like Saga leans into being a comic for adults by putting adult material in there just because it can. That said, I'll admit that I have a certain amount of inherent prudishness that may be coloring my thinking there. More importantly, I enjoy the art, the story is getting better and more interesting, and I'm eager to keep reading.
