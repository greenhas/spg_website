Heck of a volume right here; I can see how it would be frustrating for the series to go on hiatus right after this, and I'm glad I'm reading the series post-hiatus. It's interesting to see just how willing Vaughan is to change things up hard, and I wonder how this will affect the running themes of the book moving forward. As usual, it's also fascinating to follow the beautiful, very weird art. Most of this volume takes place at an abandoned, derelict theme park. It's a choice that is very weird but somehow fits this series perfectly.
