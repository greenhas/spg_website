This is a frank, vulnerable memoir that I learned a lot from; I'm glad for Kobabe's willingness to share eir story. I also appreciated the art style. I'd been meaning to read this in print a while ago but had checked out too many books from the library and had to return it before I got to it. I'm glad it was available on Hoopla so I could read it on my phone instead of mindlessly scrolling through TVTropes.
