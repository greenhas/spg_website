I wasn't sure about this novella at first, which was a bummer because it's beloved by the folks at The Incomparable. As I kept reading, though, I got sucked in and wound up loving it! It makes the most of its short length, easily working in the worldbuilding and even lampshading the tropes it uses to do so. The characters are fun, but what stands out the most is how deliberately and delightfully non-Western it is. I'd grabbed it off of an Afrofuturism and Afrofantasy display at the library, and it's a shining example of that; it made me want to learn so much more about Egypt and its surroundings.
