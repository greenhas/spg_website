This book is one of the mainstays of the old Star Wars EU. I hadn't read it in years, but after exploring some of the new canon and hearing the news about a likely remixing of it into a Dave Filoni movie, it seemed like a good time to revisit. The audiobook production was great, and even if I'm not planning to finish the trilogy, I enjoyed checking this title out again.
