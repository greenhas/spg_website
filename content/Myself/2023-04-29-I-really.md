I really wanted to like this more than I did! North and Henderson are one of my favorite creative teams in comics, and North's dialogue and Henderson's art come together in perfect ways throughout the story. At the end of the day, though, I don't know if there was enough to that story or to the worldbuilding to really interest me. There are neat ideas in here, and the plot comes together in smart ways at times, but neither feels fleshed out enough to really stand out.
