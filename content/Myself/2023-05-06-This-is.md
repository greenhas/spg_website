This is a fun concept—a teenager named Clark Kent who's tired of the jokes about being named after the fictional Superman suddenly develops Superman's powers and has to figure out how to live with them. Busiek strikes me as the perfect person to write a story about how a world familiar with superhero tropes would deal with their becoming real, but as much as I love little bits of this story, I just don't know that it will ever stand out as a favorite of mine.
