I love Astro City. It is definitely not perfect (the creative team is a bunch of white guys, and sometimes, that's painfully obvious), but as far as I'm concerned, it's the best wholesale reimagining of superhero tropes out there. I've read every single story in this volume before, and I read them now with a more critical eye than in the past, but I had a great time rereading them all. Glad that these large collections are on hoopla, and looking forward to reading the rest.
