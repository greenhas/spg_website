I hadn't realized this webcomic had been released in print volumes, and I honestly couldn't remember how far I'd made it through the webcomic archives, so I leapt at the chance to read a collection. I think I might like this deconstructive "realistic" take on superheroes more than any other. The questions are interesting, the art is uneven but compelling, and the characters resonate with me. It's a great read.
