I recently read a lot of Saga, it's not too long ago that I gave Y: The Last Man a readthrough, and I've tried this series before, so I was expecting to like this. I did see enough in there to see why it's so often hailed as a classic, but I found it too edgy for the sake of being edgy or editorial when opportunity allowed. Lind of disappointed, and not planning to read further.
