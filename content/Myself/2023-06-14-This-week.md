Smiley has been something of a comfort read these past several years, but it's been some time since I visited the actual books, instead preferring the BBC Radio 4 dramatizations. They are superb, but I decided to listen to the "full" audiobooks this time through. Not all are available theough my library, but the best ones are, and that works just fine for me. This book shows its age in some uncomfortable ways, and it's not fully polished, but it introduces so much of what I love about George Smiley and the books built around him. I like Mendel in particular, even though he never plays a huge role. The story is interesting, it's attentive to morality, and it's a good read all around.
