The premise of the book is fun: an orc warrior in a D&D-type adventuring party retires to start a coffeeshop, coffee here being a gnomish delicacy that isn't well known. I don't drink coffee and I don't really patronize coffeeshops, but this book kind of made me wish that I did! It's a fun and cozy read with interesting characters, interesting takes on tropes, compelling descriptions of tast food, and good themes. Perhaps most importantly, when it talks about its analog to chocolate croissants, it keeps them crescent shaped (one of my pettiest peeves is when pains aux chocolat are called chocolate croissants).
