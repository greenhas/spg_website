The movie adaptation of this book is what really got me into Le Carr√©. It's twisty and cynical and compelling‚Äîjust a great book. Not perfect, of course: Its age shows uncomfortably in some places, including the way it entirely fails the Bechdel Test. I can't help but give it a full rating, though.
