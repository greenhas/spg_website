I read through this with kiddo this morning, inspired by our recent discovery of Shiga's new Adventuregame Comics. I was surprised by how little I loved it. Don't get me wrong: it's an amazing concept, an interesting story, and it deserves the praise it gets from folks like Gene Luen Yang,Scott McCloud, and others. However, revisiting it after his newer work in this subgenre, I think he does better with Adventuretime Comics! Still happy to have this on my shelf, though.
