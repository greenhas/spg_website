It's so interesting to compare this last book of his to his earlier works: There are more women (though I still don't think it passes the Bechdel Test), more cell phones, and more swears than his early stuff, but the sense of inevitable plodding toward a disappointing end (for the protagonists at least) is just as strong as ever. I found that this ending wasn't quite as strong as the buildup, but it was a fine last novel from an excellent author.
