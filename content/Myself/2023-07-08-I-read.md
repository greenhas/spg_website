I read these books ages ago, but I can hardly remember any of the details, so it's been fun to revisit this world with flashes of familiarity but mostly just waiting episode to episode to figure things out. The set design is great, the acting is good, and the music is compelling. I don't know exactly why I'm not giving it full marks (it feels a bit strained and overcomplicated sometimes, but I think that captures the source material from what I remember), but I'm looking forward to future seasons!
