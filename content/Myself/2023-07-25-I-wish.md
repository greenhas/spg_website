I wish I had read this before Gharib's second comic memoir, because there's a progression there (in terms of both the quality of art and adding detail to story) that makes it unfair to judge this one after reading it second. I think "It Won't Always Be Like This" is better, but this comic is so good, too. Great story, distinctive art, great overall product.
