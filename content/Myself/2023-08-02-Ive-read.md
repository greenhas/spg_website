I've read this a number of times already, but after reading Delisle's "Jerusalem," I had to revisit it. It's the wild, literally incredible story of the two months he spent in Pyongang supervising a team of North Korean animators who were doing work for the French animation studio Delisle worked for. The art is excellent, the writing is good, the story is bonkers. One of my favorite comics.
