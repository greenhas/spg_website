I don't even remember when this season ended, but it took a while to convince myself to get through it. The first season of this show was near-perfect, but it's gotten dumber over time, and this season was particularly disappointing. It felt stuffed with fanservice and worldbuilding I didn't care about, indecisive and self-contradictory, and like everything proceeded on the logic of plot. Makes me miss Andor.
