I skipped The Honourable Schoolboy for this Le Carr√© adventure because I think it's the weakest of the Karla trilogy, and because the BBC Radio 4 adaptation made me dread what kind of stereotypical Chinese accents an audiobook reader might adopt. I couldn't possibly skip Smiley's People, though; I think I might like it even more than Tinker Tailor, though you can't appreciate this without having read that. It has the best of Le Carr√©‚Äîcopious but not irrelevant detail, moral ambiguity without needless grittiness, and a sense of inevitability that still keeps you hooked on the story.
