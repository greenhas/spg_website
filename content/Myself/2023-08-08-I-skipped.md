I skipped The Honourable Schoolboy for this Le Carré adventure because I think it's the weakest of the Karla trilogy, and because the BBC Radio 4 adaptation made me dread what kind of stereotypical Chinese accents an audiobook reader might adopt. I couldn't possibly skip Smiley's People, though; I think I might like it even more than Tinker Tailor, though you can't appreciate this without having read that. It has the best of Le Carré—copious but not irrelevant detail, moral ambiguity without needless grittiness, and a sense of inevitability that still keeps you hooked on the story.
