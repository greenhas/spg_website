I didn't love this when I first read it after its publication, but it has grown on me since! It's fanservice, franchise-oriented writing at its best, and even if some of its details strain plausibility (just how old is Smiley?), it's fun to see behind the scenes of Leamas's narrative in *The Spy Who Came in from the Cold* and to weld that narrative to characters we know from the Karla trilogy. Le Carr√© also doesn't let up in his questions about means and ends as they relate to espionage.
