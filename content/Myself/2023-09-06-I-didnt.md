It's fanservice, franchise-oriented writing at its best, and even if some of its details strain plausibility (just how old is Smiley?), it's fun to see behind the scenes of Leamas's narrative in *The Spy Who Came in from the Cold* and to weld that narrative to characters we know from the Karla trilogy. Le Carré also doesn't let up in his questions about means and ends as they relate to espionage.
