As promised, I'm reading this in honor of Bill Willingham's badass public domain antics earlier this week. I think the concept of his series is fun, but I'm not sure if I think it's as great as its reputation. The idea of fairy tale characters living in the real world is full of potential, but the story seems pretty superficial. Will probably keep reading, though.
