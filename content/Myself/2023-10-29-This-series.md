This series continues to have a really interesting premise, and I'm giving it some grace for how much it runs with that premise and treats it seriously. It took me a long time to get through this volume, though, because it's getting a bit weird and the authors tend to fetishize the American frontier uncritically. I may come back to the series in the future, but not any time soon.
