I keep going back and forth on whether I'm going to rag on these comics for having silly comicbook logic, and now's the time I'm really going to do it. Maybe it's because I've never really cared about Venom, but this reinvention of the character feels especially silly. There's a great conversation between Peter and Nick Fury that feels like it really gets at teasing apart superhero stories in fascinating ways, but as a whole, this was just not my favorite story in the run. My hoopla borrows for the month are gone, so time to log in with a family member's account to try more Ultimate Spider-Man.
