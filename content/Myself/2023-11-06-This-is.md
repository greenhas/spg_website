title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: my thoughts on 'Daybreak, a game about fighting climate change, is blindly optimistic - Polygon'"

This is an interesting review of a game that I hadn't heard of but am now intrigued by. I wouldn't mind playing an overly optimistic game right now, but I also appreciate the central critique of the game in the review. I think there's value in recognizing the tensions that prevent us from defeating these obstacles as (relatively) easily as we can in a game.
