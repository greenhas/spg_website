I like herbal tea, but there's only so much interest I can show in a cookbook on the topic. The only reason I read this was because reading a cookbook is one of the squares on my local library's 2023 reading challenge. It could be interesting to grow my own herbs and make my own blends, but I just don't see myself doing it.
