I finally got access to my spouse's hoopla password so that I can continue my binge of this series without waiting for my loans to refresh in December. There was *a lot* that I don't like about this volume: 2000s language that doesn't age well, oversexualization of costumes and characters, and crossover nonsense. I like the characters, though, and the issue with Aunt May in therapy was good enough on its own to bump my rating up a heart. On to the next volume!
