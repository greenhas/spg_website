I picked up this comic about a post-pandemic-apocalypse from the library on a whim. I have mixed feelings about this genre‚Äîespecially since it's hard to believe that it was begun before COVID-19. The story is somewhat interesting but choppy, and the characters are compelling but flat. The translation is rouuuugh, and I wonder how much better it might be in the original German. What saves this for me, though, is how clearly Swiss it is. The Bernese patches on some uniforms, the references to Coop, and probably lots more that I've missed for not having spent that much time on this side of the Sarine. I won't miss not having the next volume available, but I really enjoyed the art and seeing all the Swiss references in there.
