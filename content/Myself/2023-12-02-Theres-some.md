There's *some* interesting stuff here, including Bendis's riffs on power and responsibility and how that relates to secret identities. However, there's too much welding to the broader Ultimate universe, including introducing characters I just don't care about. I also still feel like Peter's attitude toward MJ is more low-level misogyny than anything justified.
