I think this might be my least favorite of the three volumes I now own (need to track down the fourth to complete the collection). The first arc was good enough (and felt straight out of The Sandbaggers‚ÄîRucka borrows HEAVILY from a couple of episodes), but the second seemed like supplementary material to Rucka's novels. I like this series when it's riffing off of The Sandbaggers, but when it feels like its own thing with lots of continuity, it's harder to enjoy. The scripts that fill out the volume saved it for me, though. I didn't think I'd like them, but they were a fantastic behind the scenes peek!
