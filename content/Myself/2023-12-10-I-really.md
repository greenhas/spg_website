I really shouldn't like this volume. I don't care that much about Venom or Carnage, and I think their Ultimate origin stories are dumb. Gwen Stacy got treated terribly earlier in the series, and this comic book resurrection is as silly as her death was stupid. Yet, I thought the framing story was interesting, Venom **is** compelling as an eldritch villain, and I... enjoyed myself? Dunno what to make of all that, but four hearts it is.
