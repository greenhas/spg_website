I don't know how to deal with the renaming and renumbering going on in this series, and trying to read up on it on Wikipedia is just making me more confused. This is very clearly a "reset the status quo" effort, but it's not entirely bad? Bendis continues to mistreat Mary Jane, and I feel like it's actually getting worse, so that's not great. I do like the dynamic of Aunt May taking in more and more superheroes, though, so we'll see how that turns out.
