Fun arc! I like the whole range of characters at Bendis's disposal, and even though it strains credulity sometimes, it is fun to have Peter and friends as teenagers. Lafuente's art isn't bad, but I'm not used to it, so I have trouble recognizing Peter as Peter sometimes (especially in this arc!). Nearing the end of this journey, though I ought to read the Miles Morales volumes after that.
