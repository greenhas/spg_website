I miss the earlier art, and there's still plenty of comic book nonsense, but this series has found a good groove. I don't know a whole ton about main Marvel continuity, but I do feel like Bendis has the freedom to do his own thing here, and I gather that was the point of the Ultimate universe. Kind of wild to have the next volume's big event spoiled in this volume's title, but I guess it's been long enough for it not to matter.
