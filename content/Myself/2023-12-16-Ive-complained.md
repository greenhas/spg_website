I've complained a lot about superhero comics nonsense throughout this series, but it's still depressing to finally show that a 16-year-old wouldn't survive all of these fights. It's an interesting wrap up for this character, and I ought to find and read the Miles Morales series, but after 26 TPBs in a couple of months, I think I need a break from Spider-Man. There are other books I ought to read, and on the comics landscape, I hear there's a new Saga TPB to get caught up on.
