I had to refresh myself on the last few volumes before tackling this latest one, and there are still lots of details I can't remember. This series is gory, crude, and profane in ways that ought to turn me away from it, but it's just so compelling. Great art, powerful characters, and good story. Maybe I should actually subscribe to issues as they come out? I've never read comics in a monthly format before, but I don't know if I want to wait as long as I had to for this next TPB.
