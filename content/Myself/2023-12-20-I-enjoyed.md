I enjoyed watching this show, and I really like the aesthetic it's been rocking for its two seasons. I was inclined to give it a higher rating than this because of those factors and because I don't really have anything bad to say about it—however, I'm hard pressed to come up with any praise more substantive than "I had a fun time," so I'm going to knock off a heart for that.
