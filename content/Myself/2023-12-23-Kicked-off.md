Kicked off the family holiday gathering by watching this with my dad last night. This was a good Indiana Jones movie, I (mostly) had fun watching it, and I'm probably being a little harsh in my rating of it. 

However, for all we live in an era where punching Nazis is shorthand for some very necessary resistance to some very dangerous far-right action, I've been reading about non-violence lately, and that makes it hard to enjoy media like this. There were lots of "oh, it's the bad guys, so it's okay if they die terrible deaths" moments, and I felt uncomfortable at the idea that I was supposed to enjoy that as part of the movie. 

Maybe I'm being a stick in the mud (especially since I rated *Wish* higher than this, and I'm not sure I enjoyed that as much as this movie. I couldn't turn off my brain while watching this, though, and I can't help but let that feed into my rating.
