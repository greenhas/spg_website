I'd been meaning to read these for a while and was happy to find them collected in a single (Libby) volume. Herron is great at adding a lot to his universe full of terrible people, and I wish I recognized all the cameos and continuity nods from the main series. I did appreciate Herron's lampshading of his characters' not aging despite a decade of publication history‚Äîit was clever without feeling out of place.
