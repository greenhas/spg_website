What an excellent series this is. The finale was more violent than I'm comfortable with, but I appreciated that it never glorified the violence; rather, it fit in nicely with the series's habit of showing that as screwed up as the Slow Horses are, it's the dignified leadership of this fictional MI5 who are the real monsters. Power corrupts, and all that. I'm wondering how next series will go‚ÄîI have only vague recollections of the book, and what I do remember is that it's one of the weirder ones.
