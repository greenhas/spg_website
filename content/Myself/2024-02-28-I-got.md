I got really into Doctor Who for the better part of a decade, I have really fond memories of the many seasons I watched, and there are episodes I would gladly return to. I petered out after Jodie Whitaker's first season, though, and watching these specials showed me I'm still not ready to come back. I don't know what has changed, but I feel less patient with the show's goofiness. If it's going to keep coming to Disney+, I'll try to keep an eye on it, but hard to say if I'll ever really reinvest.
