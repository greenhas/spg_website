  entry: Definitive Edition Volume 04
---

I recently came into some Amazon gift cards, so I bought this volume to complete my collection of Queen & Country. I think this is the first time I've owned an entire comics series? At least, one of this length.

I'm glad I own the whole series, but like the show its based on, I feel like it gets less interesting the longer it goes on. It's fun to get some peeks into the backstories of the characters who come up in the first two volumes, but it's just not as interesting as the early stories. I'm sure I'll come back to the whole series at some point anyway.
