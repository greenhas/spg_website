I came for the Ms. Marvel, and this delivered! She's a great character, and it was fun to see her in this movie. There were also lots of weird-but-fun bits that I enjoyed.

There are plenty of things about the movie that didn't work for me, but it's no less dumb than most Marvel movies, and I have no interest in feeding what I understand is a bunch of hating on the movie. It's not the best MCU film out there, but it was plenty fun, and I'd blame the growing unwieldiness of the universe as much as anything about this installment for the clunky bits.
