I struggled with what to rate this series. It's great in a lot of ways, and it's fun to watch a political show that is based in a country I don't know very well (plus, explaining parliamentary coalitions and other election systems to my spouse made me feel smart).

That said, it's also not as tight and polished as something like *The West Wing*, and while it might not be fair to compare the two, it's inevitable. Some of the story arcs would land better with a bit more preparation, and some plot elements feel contrived for the sake of a specific episode. 

I'm glad I watched the first season, but I don't know if I'll be in a rush to watch the second.
