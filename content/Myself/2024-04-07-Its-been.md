It's been ages since I've listened to this, though I've listened to some of John Finnemore's other work in the meantime. It's such an excellent show: brilliantly written, well acted, and a real joy to listen to.

I'm confident I haven't listened to all four series, though I can't remember which bits I've missed. Looking forward to finding out!
