This series feels like Finnemore kicking things up a notch. There are some interesting new character arcs in play, and it's fun to see Finnemore playing with the fact that one of his actors is now taking on the role of Sherlock Holmes. He's also clearly having fun subverting some audience expectations with stories and characters.

I hadn't heard this series before, and it was fun to come back to it! I'm really excited for Series 4 and the finale episodes.
