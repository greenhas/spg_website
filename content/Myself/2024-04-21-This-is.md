This is the third time I've listened to this series in the past five years, and I wonder if I'm rating it a bit low because of that. At any rate, I couldn't help myself from trying it again after finishing Cabin Pressure. I might like this show even better—Finnemore has more freedom to show off his gift for words and his intricate plotting and callbacks.
