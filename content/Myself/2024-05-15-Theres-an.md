There's an interesting premise behind this spy thriller adaptation, and some of the radio work is pretty good, but I felt like there wasn't enough connective tissue to keep it together. I don't know how much of the weakness was in the original novel versus introduced in the adaptation—the rushed pacing makes me suspect the latter—but while I don't regret finishing it, I can't say I was impressed.
