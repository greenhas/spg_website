My spouse has been trying to get me to read the book for years, so we had to watch the show! It's an interesting premise with compelling characters (who are well cast and well acted), and I enjoyed the whole thing.

My biggest irritation with it is how the main character's nobility is seemingly celebrated. I'm no Soviet apologist—it was a repressive country that committed unjustifiable wrongs—but I would have preferred to see the Count reflect on the unmerited wealth and power he held as a member of the Russian nobility rather than be a simple victim of Marxist zeal.
