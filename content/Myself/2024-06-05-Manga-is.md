Manga is one comics tradition I've never really gotten into, but I was impressed by someone else's description of this series on Micro.blog and decided to give it a try. There are some manga conventions I'm still getting used to, and I don't know that I fully "get it" yet, but it's fun! The "cozy apocalypse" vibe it gives off is nice, and I'm looking forward to reading the next volume.
