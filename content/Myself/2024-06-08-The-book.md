The book has a fun premise for science fiction: An alien craft lands in medieval England, a series of forced worldbuilding details makes the English knights stronger than the aliens, and before you know it, they've gone to space and conquered themselves an empire. The book also has the benefit of being written in a way that anything that hasn't aged well can be attributed to the fictional characters narrating the story.
