In some ways, I can't at all relate to Dumbing of Age because my college experience was so wildly different. Yet, it's funny how I can relate so much to parts of it now, well after my college years. I don't know that I would have wanted to have this freshman year (especially not the melodramatic bits or superhero fights), but I do wish I could have learned some of the lessons in the story earlier in life. Anyway, it's a great comic.
