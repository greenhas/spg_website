You know, I'd kind of been dreading getting to this book because I remembered the climax, and I remembered not liking it. After reading it, though, I'm starting to think that it's better done than I remembered but just that it stresses me out. At any rate, this comic continues to be good, and I also feel like we're getting more Carla, which I appreciate. She's the best.
