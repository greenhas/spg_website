This was good! Not perfect: there were some rough edges, it's hard to take some scenes seriously if you've watched *The Good Place*, and there's a bad case of the Force working as the plot needs it to. Despite all that, though, I love the franchise leaning into a "actually, the Jedi kind of suck" story, and there were some interesting fight scenes and compelling story elements. Happy to see Star Wars experimenting like this... though, of course, it should be moving into the public domain so that everyone (not just Disney) can do that experimentation.
