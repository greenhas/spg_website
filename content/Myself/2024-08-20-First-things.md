First things first: I am not familiar with the source material or with the Michael Caine adaptation, so I can't make any comparisons there.

I enjoyed the beginning of the series more than the end: The fast pace usually worked for me but felt rushed in the last episode, and I preferred the more grounded elements to the semi-fantastical stuff that was eventually introduced.

That said, I thought it was well shot, well acted, and interesting spy fiction!
