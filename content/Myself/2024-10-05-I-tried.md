I tried the first episode of *Agatha All Along* with my spouse, and we both agreed we needed a refresher on this series. 

I think this is one of the best entries in the MCU—certainly for TV. The premise is weird and is committed to it; it's comic book-y but mostly in a fun way; it explores deep questions alongside action and humor; and it's willing to show how scary superpowers are. I'm glad we came back to it.
