I'm surprised to be rating this higher than previous seasons, because it's based off of one of my least favorite books in the series. I like the series more when it leans into the petty and mundane, and this book feels almost like a blockbuster spy movie with its unstoppable bad guys and conspiratorial plots.

That turns out to make for good television, though, and I thought the season finale was particularly good, in a way that raises my opinion of the whole season. I am feeling excited about this franchise and might do a reread while I wait for the fifth season to come out (not least because I'm struggling to remember the plot of the fifth book).
