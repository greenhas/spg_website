I feel like I've said this about a lot of recent comics, but while I appreciate what this contributed and what it's trying to do, I just don't like it all that much.

I'm interested in its efforts at social justice moralizing and metafiction, and I understand there will be more of that in the second volume (which I'm looking forward to), but there was too much that felt like lazy comics in here (sexist costumes, silly crossovers and events, two-dimensional characters).
