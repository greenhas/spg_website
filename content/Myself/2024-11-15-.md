I've listened to Glenn on *The Incomparable* for years, and a rule I try to follow is to pay for creative works from creators whose content I've often consumed for free. This sounded interesting, I do like comics, and so I bought it on a whim. I don't think buying a print copy was ever in the cards for me, but I wish I'd at least read it on a bigger screen than my phone: It's beautifully designed, and there are lots of visual goodies in there.

Reading this reminded me of my slow realization in the mid 2010s of how much work went into movies. I'd had a pretty naïve understanding of the process before, and it kind of blew my mind to start thinking about all the aspects of film making that I'd missed before. Likewise, even though I've read comics my whole life, and even though I knew bits and pieces of all of this, it was really cool to have my eyes opened to all the invisible steps it takes to get panels onto pages. Some bits were more interesting than others, but it was great to finish the book with a bigger appreciation for a medium I've loved my whole life.
