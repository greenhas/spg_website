I picked this up because it had Zdarsky's name on it, and Jorge Jiménez's art looked gorgeous. It was a fun read, but there are all the problems with it that I have with most modern Batman: It's violent, absurd, and bogged down in continuity. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't miss Batman all that much.
