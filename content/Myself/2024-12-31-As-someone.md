As someone who once owned *Tintin au pays des Soviets* (but also sold it more out of distaste of the art than the politics) and who is currently rereading a less-but-still-problematic classic Belgian *bande dessinÃ©e*, I really appreciated these reflections.

I hadn't realized that Tintin was about to enter the public domain, and that's exciting! I'm more optimistic that Tintin can be reclaimed from its fascist, racist roots than Werd is. I worry that that's because I haven't fully confronted those roots, but I hope it's because there's an anarchist Tintin parody/remix out there that's already demonstrated that the character can be repurposed for other means. I regret not buying the book when I had a chance to a month or two ago, but maybe Tintin in the public domain will allow me to find other subversive takes on the character.
