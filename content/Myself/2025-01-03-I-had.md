I had been thinking about rereading this for a while, and there's nothing like a transatlantic flight to get you to finally do it (even though there are two other books I "ought to" be reading.

I continue to be amazed that I like this series—and how much I like it. There are so many things about it that shouldn't work (at least for my tastes), but it somehow goes all the way around and back to captivating. I own the first ten TPBs, and I'm looking forward to reading all of those and then seeing what else I can find from the library.
