I've been a Mozilla fan for a long time, but this sort of default behavior is why I'm souring on the organization (and why I abandoned Firefox a few months ago).

![a screenshot of Firefox's new Terms of Service, which reads: "Mozilla may also receive location-related keywords from your search (such as when you search for "Boston") and share this with our partners to provide recommended and sponsored content. Where this occurs, Mozilla cannot associate the keyword search with an individual user once the search suggestion has been served and partners are never able to associate search suggestions with an individual user. You can remove this functionality at any time by turning off Sponsored Suggestions - more information on how to do this is available in the relevant Firefox Support page."](/2025-02-26-Mozilla-location.JPEG)
