I've been revisiting a lot of my comics collection in recent months, and after finally finishing XIII, I thought I'd revisit this series. In fact, I've been wanting to reread Queen & Country basically since I first read it. This first volume in particular has seen a lot of revisiting, especially the early pages.

That made it hard to appreciate the volume this time around, and it was harder to get through. It's also a product of its time in a very specific way‚Äî20+ years later, it's much harder to get excited about heroic secret agents facing off against mean old terrorists. What I love about The Sandbaggers (which inspired these comics) is the way the show reveals the moral vacuum at the heart of Cold War espionage (even for the "good guys"), and I'm not sure this series is willing to go there‚Äîat least not in its first issues.

It's still a good series, with good writing and interesting art, so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt.
