As I wrote in my last review of this volume, this really steps things up. It better captures the ugliness and senseless brutality that The Sandbaggers also did‚Äîit also liberally cribs from Sandbaggers plot points, but I see it more as loving homage than plagiarism. I still don't think it's as good as The Sandbaggers, and the changing art style sometimes bugs me, but I think this might be the peak of the series.
