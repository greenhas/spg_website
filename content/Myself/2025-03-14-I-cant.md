I can't claim to have read all of the "choose your own adventure" comics in the world, but I've read a few in my time, and this is a good one! (Though I really need to figure out how to finish Jason Shiga's latest...)

The art and the dialogue capture Lower Decks perfectly‚ÄîI could hear the characters' voices in my head as I read. I loved the puzzle-y bits, too, where you *have* to explore multiple paths (and also "cheat" at certain times) to get to a true ending. It also does what Lower Decks does best, which is to pay homage (and make fun of) what makes Star Trek fun. So glad I read this.
