I expected to rate this lower, because there's a lot stacked against it. From what I can tell, the first stories are rehashes of TOS episodes within the Kelvinverse continuity, so you've got episodic 1960s plot points transported into a comic book spinoff for a reboot movie. The uncanny valley take on the 2009 Star Trek actors in the art isn't doing it any favors either. 

It was a fun read nonetheless. Yes, comic books get dumb, and so does Star Trek, but it was enjoyable despite all that. I think I have all the IDW Star Trek series (thanks Humble Bundle!), so here's hoping I can get through it all.
