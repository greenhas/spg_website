I have some complaints about this show, but I was so relieved to find myself smiling at the jokes that I'm giving it some grace.

It's a wonder I keep listening to these, but I spent a lot of time driving this weekend and needed something to listen to‚Äîbesides, I've owned this collection for years without ever getting past *Mort*. I don't know how much longer I'll keep going, but I want to give it a try, at least.
