I'm beginning to wonder if I just don't like Discworld, which would be a tragedy, since Pratchett is revered, and it seems like I should like his style of fiction.

I at least know that I didn't really like this series, which also seems a shame, since I've always wanted to get into the Sam Vimes stories. I suspect some of it may be the adaptation: It seems just too hard to follow.
