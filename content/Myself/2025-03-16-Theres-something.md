There's something inherently fanservice-y about spinoff comics, especially comics that are interested in reimagining beloved stories for a reboot. Not all fanservice is bad, though. I think the art is getting better, I *appreciate* those riffs, and if it's not the best Star Trek, it's fun to spend time with Star Trek.
