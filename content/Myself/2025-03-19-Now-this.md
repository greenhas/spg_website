Now **this** is how a comic book company uses a Star Trek license: Using a universe-hopping Q to take the Kelvinverse Enterprise to a bad future Deep Space Nine setting for plenty of extradimensional being nonsense and fanservice. Keiko O'Brien is a starship captain! Q merges with one of the Prophets! It's not high art, but it's exactly what I want from the medium.
