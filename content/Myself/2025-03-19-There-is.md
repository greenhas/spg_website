There is one really good story in here and one okay one, but I finally found the limits of my impatient with Star Trek and/or comics nonsense, and it was a Star Wars-like "let's take a character who barely appears on screen and explain why they are the most important person in the world" story smack in the middle of the volume. Not going to stop reading the series, but it's definitely slowing me down.
