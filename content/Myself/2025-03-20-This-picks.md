This picks up near the end with some interesting ethical dilemmas (though it's not clear how much of a dilemma they actually are), but it feels like the interesting premise of the first volume has kind of run out of steam. I'm still considering picking up the third volume (and I wonder if I've been too harsh on this one), but I can't say it's kept my attention as much as I'd hoped.
