I have a lot of complaints about this volume, not least making Khan look like Benedict Cumberbatch. It also has some of the stronger stories of this series, so I'm trying to give it some benefit of the doubt.---

I have more Star Trek IDW comics to read, but I've completed this whole series! It ended on a good note, with a tribute to Leonard Nimoy and then some semi-fourth-wall breaking explorations of what it means for there to be two timelines in "main" Star Trek canon.
