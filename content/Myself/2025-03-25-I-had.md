I had an awful experience with the last Sam Vimes adaptation, so I wasn't sure about this‚Äîespecially since it is one of the longer adaptations in the collection I have. I think the key is the adapter, though, because Robin Brooks's shows have been my favorites, and this one was quite good.

I really got why people like Sam Vimes stories, I appreciated nods to Discworld continuity even if I didn't understand them, and I am a real sucker for "time travelling into your own past" stories. It was even not terribly problematic for a cop story, which was nice. I am finding some renewed faith in Discworld!
