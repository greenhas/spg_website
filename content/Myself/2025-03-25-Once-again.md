Once again, anthologies are fun. I almost didn't read this, because it felt weird to read and review a single issue of a comic, but I'm glad I did! Q meets Decker who's wrestling with what it means (along with Ilia and V'Ger) to be an all-powerful being! There's a funny and great story about Data's cat! Ezri Dax consults with past symbiont hosts in a way that makes it seem more interesting than DS9 ever did! These are fun.
