I'm in a grumpy mood this morning, so I might be a little harsh here, but nothing's really standing out. There are some interesting things here (Spock resisting the Borg! Minor Wrath of Khan cameo!), but I think there are continuity errors, and even if there aren't, it's just not super interesting.
