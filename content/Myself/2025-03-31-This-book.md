This book reminds me of Herv√© Le Tellier's *L'Anomalie*, which feels insulting and maybe even heretical. *L'Anomalie* is a Prix Goncourt-winning, highbrow, Oulipo novel; this is by a guy who writes Star Trek parodies and kaiju books. *L'Anomalie* is relatively restrained in its conceit, with an impossible "duplicate" plane landing three months after the original one; this has the moon turn into cheese for a lunar cycle.

Yet, both books are powerful in their exploration of how the world responds when something ridiculous and clearly impossible happens. This one is also a quick, easy, funny read in a way that prize-winning French books aren't always. 

The best science fiction treats ridiculous premises seriously, and this does a good job of that. Yes, it makes me want to reread *L'Anomalie*, but it also does a great job on its own.
