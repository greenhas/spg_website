I love these radio dramas so much. I honestly can't remember if (an imagined) Ann serves as a narrator in the original book, but she does in the dramas to great effect.

I can't listen to *Call for the Dead* without thinking about the ambiguous continuity of the Smileyverse. On one hand, Smiley feels like a one-off character here, and it's weird to start him off as resigning from the Circus when Le Carr√© will want to use that to greater effect later on. At the same time, this sets up so much of the world that Le Carr√© will later flesh out, so it's a fantastic beginning of the franchise.

I appreciate that the radio adaptation doesn't try to reconcile the conflicts and disparities that will come up in future works. It just takes the story as is‚Äîand it's a good story, so I can't complain.

Also, Simon Russell Beale is my definitive Smiley‚Äîthough maybe because I've listened to these so many times.
