In some ways this is the least interesting of the Smiley stories. There's something fun about a retired Smiley doing detective work, and it's fascinating to get glimpses at the British class system, but it's not Smiley in his element (as it will later become), and it feels like a distraction in that sense.

Yet, the radio adaptation is so, so nicely done that I can't help but give it full marks. I've listened to a lot of radio dramas recently, and this series is avoiding all the sins of the medium while providing some powerful strengths. Top notch.
