I won't pretend to be able to distinguish the very fine line that separates boring comic nonsense from amazing comic nonsense, but this is on the right side of things.

Gary Mitchell elevates Kelvinverse Kirk to godhood so that they can play a game of multiversal chess using as pieces infinite Kirks in infinite combinations. The gender-flipped Enterprise comes back! There's a Kirk raised by Klingons and a Spock ("Simon Grayson") who's rejected his Vulcan side! Everything is bonkers (I didn't even mentioned the gas-based Scotty), but I appreciate a big swing.
