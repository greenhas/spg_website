I know that "Tinker, Tailor" is good, and I'm looking forward to revisiting it for the nth time, but I really think this is the best of the Smileyverse. The most twisty, the most cynical, the most appalled at its own cynicism. It's no surprise that the most recent additions to the Smileyverse have revisited this story‚Äîit's the best.
