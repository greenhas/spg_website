"Came In From the Cold" may be Le Carr√©'s best, but I think "Looking Glass" is my favorite. That's true of the book, but Ian McDiarmid as an incompetent agency director is also a lot of fun.

Le Carr√© has a particular kind of plot that boils down to "stupid people making stupid decisions," and I think this is the best of them. It's a damning story of toxic World War II nostalgia, desperation to be doing something meaningful with one's life, and manipulation by more competent cynics. It plays out like a train wreck that you know will end in disaster but you can't help but watch. I love it so much, and I wish it got more references in later Smileyverse stories.
