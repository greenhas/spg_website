I'm rating this higher than on my last readthrough. I couldn't tell you why I held back last time, but this time, I was reminded of some excellent strips that have really made an impression on me, so full marks.

Why am I rereading in the first place? I did two full(ish) archive binges of DoA in 2024, so I don't strictly need to reread this. I did back the Book 14 Kickstarter, though, and I wanted to have some context for when that PDF arrives. I've also been doing a lot of comics rereads in 2025, so even though I definitely don't have the energy for another archive binge, I thought I'd revisit everything post timeskip.
