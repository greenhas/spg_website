I made a mistake with this reread‚Äînot in the reread itself but in starting it this early. I forgot how much these collections suck me in‚Äîand, therefore, how quickly I go through them‚Äîso now I'm done and there are still several weeks to go before the next PDF gets delivered to me and I *still* have to disentangle my brain between what I'm reading daily and the specific context of the new collection. It's not a huge deal (and I liked this collection!), but food for thought before the next time I try this.
