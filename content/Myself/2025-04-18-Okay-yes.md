Okay, yes, I *just* listened to this a couple of months ago, but I was doing a relisten of the BBC Radio 4 Smiley adaptations, and I wanted to see how this held up reading it where it fits chronologically. It holds up well!

I like this novel a lot. It's fun to see Smiley being competent in the field, and I appreciate how it complicates Ann without making Smiley the bad guy in the relationship. It's the fun kind of fanservice, and while I hope this doesn't go all Tom Clancy in its posthumous franchization, I wouldn't mind another from Harkaway.
