This is a funny show to rate! I believe I learned about it from David Loehr on The Incomparable, who spoke highly of it. I did enjoy watching it, which is why I'm pretty positive about it.

Thinking about it critically, the overarching plot is kind of hard to follow, the individual mysteries don't have any way of solving them but "trust that brilliant main character is brilliant," and the show almost knows how contrived its confessions at the end of each episode are. 

Yet, David Mitchell plays a great quirky puzzle guy, the other characters are also compelling, and the ideas are fun even when the execution is poor. I guess all that makes up for the rest, because I can't bring myself to be any harsher.
