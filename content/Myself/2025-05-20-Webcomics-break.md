Webcomics break my reviewing assumptions in interesting ways. I recently spent a lot of time binging the OOTS archives, with over 1,000 pages of material, without writing any reviews, because that wasn't a "book." This 75ish-page comic, though, gets a review.

Anyway, that binge reminded me of how much I love this webcomic, which is why I'm kind of surprised not to like this prequel. Maybe it's because it's anchored to the beginning, gag-a-strip format, before the story gets really interesting. Maybe it's because it's B&W and doesn't have a lot of depth. I don't know, but it's not going to stop me from trying to build up a collection of the PDFs of other volumes in the series.
