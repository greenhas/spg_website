I forgot for a while there that I was waiting for this to come out on hoopla! I finally remembered yesterday, looked it up, and checked it out.

I think I'll appreciate this volume more when I can binge read it alongside some of the others. I forgot some of the context for the major plot developments, which got in the way some. It continues to be a weird-but-amazing series, though, and I can't believe how easily it hooks me, despite forgetting the context and despite the levels of blood and violence being higher than I usually tolerate.
