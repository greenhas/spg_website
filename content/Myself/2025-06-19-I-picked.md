I picked this up (along with Arca, some titles I'll be reading and reviewing in the future, and a few that I'm going to skip because they are Not My Thing) in a Humble Bundle for recent IDW titles. I've read Wilson's run on Ms. Marvel (or at least most of it), but I've bounced off some of her other stuff, so I wasn't sure what I'd think of this.

I like it! I am uncomfortable with some of the depictions of violence, but I like the romance aspects, and I'm always a fan of a fantasy story that challenges fantasy tropes.

There are some pacing and character issues that are more due to the medium (an issue-by-issue comic) than Wilson's writing, but even despite those, I got hooked. I was disappointed to find that this is the only TPB out so far, and I hope to remember to check back for further volumes in the future.
