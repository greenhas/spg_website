This was Star Wars at its best, and there is (unfortunately) no better time than now for it to come out.

I've wrestled a lot recently with the tension between my love for Star Wars and my aspiration toward non-violence. I don't know that I agree with this series's implicit argument that sometimes ugly things are necessary to make a better world, but I appreciate that it deals with that ugliness rather than just letting Luke blow up the Death Star without counting how many people that act of self-defense killed.
