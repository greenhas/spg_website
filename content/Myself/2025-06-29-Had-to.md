Had to watch this after finishing Andor, and I spent the first half of it being disappointed??? I thought I remembered this being one of my favorite Star Wars movies, but after the depth and maturity of its tv prequel, it feels kind of superficial.

The last few sequences won me back, though. Andor is the superior story, but this is a fine action movie and a marvelous piece of fanservice. I don't think I'll ever like it as much as I used to, but for the Battle of Scarif and Vader's terrifying hallway scene, I will still give it full marks.
