This is a very Ryan Northy comic, and I mean that as a compliment. It's a great adaptation of the Lower Decks vibe (and Fenoglio's art is a fantastic recreation), but it also has a lot of North's signature moves. I love his physical comic adaptation of webcomics' alt text jokes, his voice in those jokes, and his fun with science and public domain characters. I don't know how much more there is in this series, but I'll be keeping an eye out for additional volumes.
