I didn't want to like this. The IDW comics bundle I've been working through has been kind of a mixed bag, and this was weird from the get-go. A fast-food employee robs an entire strip mall, which gets him entangled in an effort to summon the devil on earth. It doesn't sound like my thing at all.

It's so unashamed of its weirdness, though, that it comes all the way around to amazing. Its characters are interesting, it focuses on a story and doesn't care about wrapping things up beyond that, and it's evocative in a way I never would have expected. I like stories that commit to the weird, and this does it‚Äîwith some good art, to boot.
