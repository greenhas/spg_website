This took a while to get through for a book I enjoyed so much. It has Andor-level grittiness and complex characters and narratives that make it better than a lot of Star Wars stuff. The audiobook's use of Star Wars music and sound effects is also a big plus. I've already checked out the final book in the trilogy so that it's not another two years before I wrap it up!
