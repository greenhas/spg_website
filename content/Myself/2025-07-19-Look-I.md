Look, I know I haven't read enough of the Murderbot source material to get snippy about unfaithfulness of adaptations. What's more, this is a pretty good show! Great design, great casting, and lots of fun.

I just didn't like it as much as I remember liking the novella. I got annoyed by what felt like unnecessary expansions, and there are parts of the worldbuilding that just can't be captured on TV. Skarsgård does a great job but doesn't capture how I perceived the main character. I just feel grumpy about it even though I recognize that it's good.
