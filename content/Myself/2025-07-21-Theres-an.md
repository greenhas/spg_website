There's an interesting story in here, and I'm usually a fan of Le Carré's "naïve characters make bad decisions and things go poorly" plots. I just cannot get over what feels like exaggerated East Asian accents in the performance, though. What could be a really interesting exploration of colonization, American intervention, etc. feels more like orientalism, especially when I'm not sure all the actors doing the accents are of East Asian heritage themselves.
