I love this story, and the radio production is excellent. I like the supporting cast of oddball characters (especially Connie and Toby), and the idea of George's struggle with his age and his morals is compelling. Maybe it's still being torn about *Honourable Schoolboy*, but it just didn't land as well this time as it has in the past.
