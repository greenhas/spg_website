I definitely read this one too fast, but if I hadn't, I probably would have gotten hung up more on the continued blood and gore, which I continue not to like.

As with the rest of the series, though, there's plenty that kept me coming back, and even the stuff I don't like is consistent(ish) with the universe that these creators have established. The happy ending is satisfying, the big swings are still interesting, and Eve gets treated better in the final arcs than in earlier stories (though I think they could have done even better by her). It's a good series, despite my reservations, and I hope it never gets rebooted.
