This was a delight to read. While the Apple TV adaptation is excellent (I can't help but imagine the book's characters as the show's actors), revisiting this reminded me just how good the source material is, too. Herron likes to play with the audience in a way that a TV show can't capture, and some of the best lines from the adaptation are taken straight from his writing. What a gem.
