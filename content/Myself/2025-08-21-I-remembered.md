I remembered this book being overly complicated and the TV adaptation being far superior. Revisiting it, though, is shifting my opinion. I think the TV adaptation does a good job of streamlining the story and connecting it to the broader franchise, but even if the original plot is convoluted, I think it's better than I first gave it credit for. I also continue to appreciate Herron's writing tics and what they add to the story that you couldn't so in television.
