Kiddo was off school yesterday, so we took a trip to the library, where I saw the first 7-8 TPBs of this series on the shelf. I nearly checked out the first four, but on second thought, I put them back. This series shouldn't work for me. It's not my preferred style of art, it's full of body and existential horror, and one of the reasons I put those TPBs back is because I was concerned I wouldn't be able to sleep if I tried reading them.

Something stuck with me, though, and I decided to check this mega volume out on Hoopla (which is worse for the library's budget, so sorry, JCPL). It's... good! Not my favorite kind of comic, but the horror has a meta level to it: Do we believe that there's nothing but awful in this life, or do we believe that there is hope that we can eke out of all the troubles. That plays out on the page, and that makes this worth reading.
