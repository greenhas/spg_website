I can't remember if I've read the color editions before, but I know I haven't read paper copies before, so this is fun. I have never seen the movie, but I've seen enough YouTube clips to know it's my style. After watching enough of those clips, and knowing that I'm not likely to watch the movie (since it's not my wife's style, and I don't watch a lot of movies on my own), I say "I ought to just read the books." This is my second time doing so, I think?

Anyway, it's fun so far, and if I don't think the first volume is the best, I'm looking forward to where it goes.
