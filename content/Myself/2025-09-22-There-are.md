There are a few IDW comics that I got in a summer Humble Bundle but couldn't bring myself to read over the summer. I'm glad I gave this one a try. I figures that after reading so much *Ice Cream Man*, I might be more open to a horror comic than I thought, and I think I was right. There is a lot of interesting character work, ethical reflection, and even heist plot in this one, and I'm looking forward to seeing what's next.
