It's not great literature, but I don't remember ever having read it, and it felt like the kind of escapist fun I could use right now. I think the Alphabet Squadron series is a superior successor in terms of having something to say beyond escapism, but Corran Horn is a fun Mary Sue to read about, and I think I'll keep reading.
