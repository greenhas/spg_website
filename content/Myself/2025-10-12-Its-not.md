It's not my favorite book in the series, but it isn't bad. There are some interesting plot developments here, but I also feel like Diana Taverner is stuck with the idiot ball from page one, which isn't as fun as it could be. Won't stop me from continuing to read, though.---

It's not great literature, but I don't remember ever having read it, and it felt like the kind of escapist fun I could use right now. I think the Alphabet Squadron series is a superior successor in terms of having something to say beyond escapism, but Corran Horn is a fun Mary Sue to read about, and I think I'll keep reading.
