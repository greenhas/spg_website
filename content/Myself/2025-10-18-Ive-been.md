I've been waiting for this one for a while, and I got weak and ceded to Hoopla rather than wait for the TPB to arrive at my local library.

I continue to appreciate this series, and Issue 43 (the real horror is what's going on in the world right now) is really good, a highlight of the whole thing. I have to admit, though, that it didn't otherwise feel worth the wait. Maybe I got my expectations too high, or maybe there are just diminishing returns. I'm not giving up on the series, but I feel like it's uneven.
