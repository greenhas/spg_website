I have tried to rewatch this a few times since discovering it in 2023, and I've always stalled out by the final episode of Series 1, which is so cruel and cynical that it's difficult to watch. Yet, it fits nicely with the themes of the show (and especially the first series), so I'm glad I made it through this time. I'm still critical of the misogyny and brownface that led me to dock points from my last review, but seeing how carefully the show sets up that final episode of the series (especially during an era where season arcs weren't nearly as important as they later became) has won my respect.
