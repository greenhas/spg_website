This season wasn't awful so much as "just okay," but I've come to expect more from the show. It took my least favorite book and changed it in weird ways that didn't feel like they fixed much. A few changes were good, but others felt like they added too much complexity to the plot or that they were trying to lend a gravitas to characters that don't need it.
