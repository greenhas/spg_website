I was more generous to the first series this time around because I was impressed by how tightly it works as a single story, despite being episodic. While there are lots of gems in this series, it doesn't feel as tightly constructed, and there are also some weird things that don't really work for me (like a conspiratorial diatribe against the FBI?). I don't regret rewatching it, but it just isn't as good as the first series.
