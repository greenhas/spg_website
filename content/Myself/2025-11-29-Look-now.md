Look, now more than ever, I'm sympathetic toward a story of Canadian resistance to American bullying, and you'd think that giant mech combat would only make that more appealing.

There are just too many strikes against this to be better than "meh," though. I don't like blood and gore in my comics, the characters are kind of flat, and the French dialogue needs another edit.
