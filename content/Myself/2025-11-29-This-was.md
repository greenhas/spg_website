This was dumb. It's the kind of comic that's intentionally offensive, but that doesn't stop it from being dumb and offensive.

The only thing keeping me from rating it lower is that there's the spark of something interesting in there. Compelling art! Is Jay Leno POTUS, with Dick Cheney as his VP?! It's Alan Moore's Comedian turned up to 12! None of that is enough to make it good, but it's worth some recognition, I guess.
