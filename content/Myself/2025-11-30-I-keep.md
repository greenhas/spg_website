I keep expecting to like Matt Fraction stuff to be better than I do because I've heard so much good stuff about him. There's something interesting in here, but it also seems sleazy and grimy as an intentional style decision, and I don't know if that's my kind of fiction. I'll probably keep reading this, and it was helpful to read the cast pages at the end so I could remember who everyone was, but I don't know if I'll like it any more.
