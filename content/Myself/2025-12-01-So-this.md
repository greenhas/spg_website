So, this still doesn't sit totally right with me. The sleaze as art choice is still not my style, and I'm not sure which side of the "artistic vs. objectifying" it falls on, though the former is clearly the goal. I also think that plot and character "development" sometimes move too quickly to really land.

If I'm more generous toward this volume, though, it's because it's more clear what the creators are trying to do here. The characters are more compelling, with backstories and relationships that make them interesting. The plot twists add genuine drama. It feels like they are trying to prove that comics can be a serious, "adult" (in not just one sense of the term) medium, and I think they mostly succeed? It feels like a comics equivalent of all those blockbuster TV shows I don't watch, and I can give it credit for that even if there are reasons I tend not to watch those shows.

One volume left: We'll see how things wrap up, and then on to another TPB in this huge Image Humble Bundle I'm working through.
