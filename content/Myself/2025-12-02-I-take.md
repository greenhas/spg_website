I take my tea without milk or anything else—one of the big reasons I got into tea and not coffee was so I could just steep the tea and be done with things. That has an effect on my tea preferences, though, since I won't ever have other flavors in the cup.

All of this to say that this is right at the edge of "too strong" for me. Breakfast teas are growing on me: They're one of the reasons I'm excited about this advent calendar. I do like the malty taste, and alternating sips with spoonfuls of muesli was a good experience. It's also a flavor I'm growing into, though, and I wonder if I would have liked it more if I'd steeped it differently (or had a single cup/bag instead of my usual two).

Shame that there aren't more bags of this in the advent calendar, because I'd like to experiment more with this blend. There will be some more "breakfast" teas, though, so I'll try to remember all this for when they come up.
