I was pretty excited for this one, and it wasn't bad, but there wasn't enough chai flavor and there definitely wasn't enough vanilla. Maybe I steeped it wrong? Maybe I'm too tired this morning to appreciate it? I don't know, but I'm tired of giving out "good but not great" ratings and was hoping this would really impress me.
