I was just posting this morning about how great this idea of teablogging is, but I'm going to immediately undercut that my questioning my ability to rate teas in the first place.

This is the most interesting and enjoyable blend I've had so far in the advent calendar, and for that, it gets a higher rating than anything I've tried so far. Yet, I think I'd also tire of it more quickly than most of the other blends I've tried, so in the long term (rather than as a first impression), I think it would rate lower. I could drink the vanilla chai every morning even if it was a bit disappointing, but I think I'd have to space the bergamot and jasmine flavors of this blend out or else I'd quickly get sick of it.

I'm a professor, and it's nearing the end of my semester, so it feels right to be engaging in a bit of evaluation nihilism here, but let's just settle on saying that I'm glad to have come across something interesting, even if I'm equally glad I don't have to commit to a whole tin of it.
