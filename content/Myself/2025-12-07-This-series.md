This series continues to be compelling, even if I have some complaints about it. Casey's dialogue for Black characters sometimes feels stereotypical, I don't love his use (or depiction) of rape as a plot point, and (like some of the other Image series I've read) I feel like there's a fine line between "comics can be a mature medium" and "let's draw all the boobs and butts we can."

And yet. This is a more interesting Batman story than so many actual Batman stories I've read. For all my baseline prudishness and legitimate concerns, I don't (usually) think this is just mature content just to be titillating, and I really want to see how things play out.
