This series works best when it explores its basic premise, and for that premise to work, the characters have to kind of remain pastiches of better known Batman ones (though, to the author's credit, they are much more interesting than superficial parodies). Yet, as the series goes on, Casey seems to want to explore  worldbuilding rather than riff on the original premise of the book, and I just don't find that interesting. Also don't love AT ALL that he is riffing off of an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory for the name of his actual world-controlling conspiracy. Feels like a major faux pas.
