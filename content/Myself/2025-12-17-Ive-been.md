I've been a Star Wars fan for long enough to recognize unnecessary expanded universe material when I hear it, but I've also been a Star Wars fan for long enough to know that some of it is actually pretty good.

I've known about this book for ages and always wanted to read it because the idea of the Kobayashi Maru is just fun. I was delighted to find an audiobook on the Internet Archive and enjoyed listening to it. James Doohan can only do so many voices (I had trouble telling his Chekov from his Scotty), but I appreciated what he brought to the role, the music and sound effects weren't bad, and the premise paid off.
