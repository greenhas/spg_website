I bought a one-pound bag of this blend last April without ever tasting it. I generally like chai, and I generally like Elmwood Inn, so I figured it wasn't too much of a gamble.

It turns out that this tastes different than any other chai I've had. It's not cinnamony like some chais, but it's also not the ginger and pepper combination that I really like in chais. Maybe it's authentic in some way that I don't appreciate, but it was a real disappointment at first. With time, it grew on me, but coming back to it after drinking none of it in December is reminding me how much of a disappointment it is.
