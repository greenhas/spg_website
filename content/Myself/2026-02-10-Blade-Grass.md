This story is maybe the most heartwarming and beautiful that I've heard in the entire collection! The Sixth Doctor visits a stroke patient in the hospital and takes him into his own future to see a few important events that he'll miss because he never recovers from the stroke. It really emphasizes that you don't have to be important to matter and encourages the listener to be kind in small ways. I really liked it.
