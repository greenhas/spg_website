Loved this one. It tells the story of The Fourth Doctor and Romana visiting a café owner who is actually a galactic tyrant who got body swapped with a café owner forty years ago and now lives out a much more meager existence on earth. The Doctor checks in on him every decade or so, and even though he resents the whole thing, it's kind of working for the villain's rehabilitation. It was clever, funny, and made me want to watch Tom Baker-era Doctor Who, so full marks.
