Expanded universe material can get very dumb very quickly, but sometimes, it's a great way to explore stuff that the main canon didn't have time for. Just like it was a delight to have Christopher Eccleston back as the Ninth Doctor, getting more from John Hurt as the War Doctor is a treat. The story is interesting enough, but it's really just fun to play with these action figures for a bit,
