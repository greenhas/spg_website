When one is at a gaming café, one pays one's dues to help keep the place open, but the chai latte was a bad choice. It tasted like warm milk with some cinnamon mixed in, and maybe that works for some people, but it's not what I'm looking for. I might just go for some "regular" tea the next time I'm there—or support the café in some other way.
