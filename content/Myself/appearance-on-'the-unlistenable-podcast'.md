A few weeks ago, I sat down with Lexi Lishinski, a good friend from grad school, to appear on an episode of her podcast *The Unlistenable Podcast*. To quote the About page for the podcast:

> It’s not called that because it has dreadful audio quality, although that may be true. It’s called that because you can’t listen to it, because I’m not going to release the episodes. This solves literally every issue that ever stopped me from recording a podcast.

I love this idea so much, and I've loved it ever since I learned about *The Unlistenable Podcast* from a mutual friend, so it was a real honor to be invited to do a guest non-appearance. Lexi recently visited Switzerland with her family, and she remembered from grad school just how much of a Helvetophile I was, so that was the theme of our episode, which you can read about [in the description](https://unlistenablepodcast.com/blog/2022-10-04-spencer/) but will never be able to listen to, because, well, see above. It was great to catch up with Lexi, though, and now I send her stuff about Swiss trains because she gets why they're awesome.
