During my two years living in France and Switzerland, I fell deeply in love with travel by rail. But alas, I live in a particularly rail-unfriendly region of a rather rail-unfriendly country. One of my guilty internet pleasures is consuming rail-related media so that I can feel like I'm having train experiences anyway.

[Geoff Marshall's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/geofftech2/videos) is a favorite of mine. [Le Ferrovipathe](https://www.youtube.com/@LeFerrovipathe) and [Urban Traveler](https://www.youtube.com/@_urbantraveler) are a couple of Francophone channels that I like much more, but that produce less content. That said, I'd gladly rewatch Urban Traveler's [#TourDeFranceEnTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoxXBLKBMdk&list=PLYCt3Jvwi8MCrkQGA3ot0X4y7GmOAqyob&pp=iAQB) or [Tour de Suisse en train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNpBW8evu1s&list=PLYCt3Jvwi8MAygYWgu7D7n085aOtJNP7B&pp=iAQB) series, which make me ache for the experience of taking European rail. 

Anyway, thanks to one of Geoff's more recent videos, I came across Ian Marchant and some of his own enthusiasm for trains. One of the few things I could easily track down after scouring his Wikipedia page and personal website was [this fun BBC Radio 4 broadcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p074jv2r) where he visits a number of "ghost stations": railway stations that are kept open to avoid the hassle of closing them down, even though there are few (or no!) services provided through them.

I bookrmarked this video a couple of weeks ago, but I finally made some time to listen to it today while my eyes were recovering from dilation after an eye doctor's appointment. It is a bonkers little program, with a lot of love for trains and some unbelievable details about British rail. I really enjoyed it, and I heartily recommend it to anyone with similar listening preferences.
