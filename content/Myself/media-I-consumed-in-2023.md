My dad has been logging the books he reads since he was a teenager, and I've always wanted to try something like that out. I gave it a go in 2022 with a notebook, but I quickly realized I wanted to journal that information, too. 

Since I journal in Day One, that meant logging reading digitally, so at the end of 2022, I started building some Siri Shortcuts for blogging about books. Once I did it for books, it was easy enough to expand the system to TV and movies, too.

I knew Micro.blog had some discovery feeds for posts about books and other media, so I built the appropriate emoji into my mediablogging system so I could participate in that as well. There's a feed for video games, and I probably ought to build in a review system for that, too, but I don't know how to determine when I've played enough of a game to review it.

Anyway, I've really enjoyed this throughout the year, and it recently occurred to me that I could also use this system to count the books I read (and other media I consumed) in 2023. So, one final Siri Shortcut later, it's time to look at the year in media.

Here are the movies I watched this year:

Here are the books I read this year. I have an absurd books-per-year count, so it's important to specify that in addition to my being a fast and avid reader, this number is inclusive of comics. I'm not interested in giving ammunition to "comics aren't books" people, because they absolutely are, but since I can read a TPB in half an hour, my book count for 2023 is probably inflated when compared to non-comics readers. Also, there are at least two books I read twice, and I wrote separate posts for each (though I didn't doublepost for the three volumes of *Saga* I reread before checking out Volume 11).

Anyway, here they are:
