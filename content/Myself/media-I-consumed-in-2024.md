Setting up media reviews for my blog is one of the best side projects that I've done in the past couple of years, and I'm happy to be doing a yearly recap for 2024 like I did for 2023. In fact, I started a new review workflow for listening to radio shows, which feels like a bonus (and helps take away from my lower read count this time around). 

Before my 2025 edition of this, I hope to revamp my review posting some. I know just enough about custom taxonomies and templates in Hugo that I'm confident that with an afternoon or two of work, I could give my reviews some more interesting, almost Goodreads-like features. Fingers crossed that I can find the time to make that happen!
