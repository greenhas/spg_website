Thanks to a recommendation from [Boing Boing](https://boingboing.net/2022/08/29/someone-documented-the-many-references-and-samples-in-they-might-be-giants-songs.html), I've spent part of this afternoon watching this amazing video cataloging "Every Music Reference & Sample in They Might Be Giants Songs": 

{{< youtube id="K7cG1R6YFzw">}}

*Flood* was one of the first albums I ever owned (I think it was beat by the deluxe soundtrack for *Star Wars: A New Hope*, but not by much), and while I don't listen to TMBG as often as I ought to, videos like these remind me how much I love the band. I've mostly appreciated them for their weirdness, but it's been amazing to see how aware they are of other music and how they bring it into their own discography. This is also a beautiful example of everything being a remixâ€”we ought to spend more time supporting that rather than constraining it.
