Kiddo starts at a new school on Wednesday, and I've been putting off signing the Acceptable Use Policy and Chromebook Policy because I want to read them carefully. I don't know how much I can do about anything that I'm really concerned with, but I'm a tech researcher when I'm not being kiddo's dad, so I feel an obligation to be informed and raise a fuss when something is fussworthy. 

Reading the AUP carefully reminded me of R. Sikoryak's *[Terms and Condition: The Graphic Novel](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/terms-and-conditions/)*, a comic that I've been meaning to read for years. The premise is that Sikoryak has adapted the entire iTunes Terms of Conditions (as it existed at the time) into a comic book, illustrating it in the style of different well-known comic artists. It's a great premise for a couple of reasons, and reading through these similar documents made me double-down on "I'm going to own this someday." 

I went over to Amazon to make sure it's still being sold and see how much it costs these days. I would **never** actually buy it from Amazon (indie bookstores forever!) but Amazon is handy for looking things like this up. Scrolling through the preview feature, I saw this amazing example of how the book works: Steve Jobs as Frank Miller's Batman in *The Dark Knight Returns*.

There are a couple of homages to TDKR in *The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl* that I think will always be my favorite shout-outs to the comic, but seeing Jobs and Carrie Kelley on the same page literally made me laugh out loud. Time to get this book sooner rather than laterâ€”more importantly, though, time to read through the docs from kiddo's school without Sikoryak's help.
