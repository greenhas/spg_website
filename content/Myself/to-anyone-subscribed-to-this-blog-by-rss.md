I don't know how many folks are subscribed to this blog via RSS, but if you are, chances are that you subscribed out of an interest in my professional writing. I'm making some big changes to the blog in part to give me the freedom to start writing on some other topics as well. You've probably seen some of these posts already, but I want to make it clear that it's going to continue. With this in mind, I've put together a list of RSS feeds available for my site at [this link](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/rss/). I certainly don't mind if folks continue to subscribe to all the content coming out of this blog, but I also want to give folks the chance to only subscribe to the content that they're interested in.
