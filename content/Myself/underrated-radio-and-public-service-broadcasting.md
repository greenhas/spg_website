Over the past few weeks, I've been trying to listen to more internet radio, getting back into the great NPR quiz show *Wait Wait Don't Tell Me* and generally thinking about how underrated radio is as a medium. This morning, a chance comment from a familiy member had me checking the website for *Public Service Broadcasting*, a strange and wonderful "found audio" band that I count among my favorites. Thanks to checking that website, I learned that PSB has a new album out based on their appearance last month at the BBC Proms celebrating BBC Radio's 100th anniversary.

I currently have up the YouTube recording of this appearance, which I'm also including below. Maybe I shouldn't be blogging about this before I finish the video, but as the presenter says in the first few minutes, there's really no better band than PSB to celebrate the early days of radio, and I'm so tickled that all of this has come together to add something interesting to my Monday morning:
