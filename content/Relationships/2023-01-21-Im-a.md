This morning, though, a friend visiting Brussels offered to bring me back a copy of Delisle's « Chroniques de Jeunesse », so when I went to the library later in the day, I couldn't help but pick up something else he's done. His art is great, and his stories are funny and sweet. My only complaint is that I couldn't read the original French edition (though I should be glad Kentucky libraries carry the English translations!).
