This does an excellent job, and it was a favorite for my whole family when it came out. (In fact, I hdn't remembered until rewatching it that one of my family's shared verbal tics comes from a running gag involving Ron Wilson, Bus Driver). When the latest episode of The Incomparable covered this movie, I decided to watch it with my daughter, who also loved it. It's funny, well-plotted, and endearing, and I'm glad to have rewatched it for the first time in years and years.
