I don't remember how I first discovered Jason Shiga, but I do remember working my way through his interactive puzzle comic *Meanwhile* one summer, some of it while purportedly completing an internship. *Meanwhile* is one of the first comics I added to my collection and one of the few of my early acquisitions that I still have. Anyway, all of that is to say that when I saw this comic in the new children's books area at a local library, I immediately grabbed it. *Meanwhile* is a bit dark for kids, as I found when I tried it with kiddo some time ago, but this is more accessible, just as fun, and even improves on the physical format of *Meanwhile*. It works like a cross between a puzzle adventure game and a choose your own adventure book, and kiddo loved it. I also worked my way through the book‚Äîit's the kind of book you have to "beat," not "finish." It's excellently done, and I can't wait for the next in the series to come out‚Äîor to revisit Meanwhile!
