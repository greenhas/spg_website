I'd been meaning to watch this, and kiddo was happy to walk me through it (she'd seen it in theaters). The animation is beautiful and there are lots of fun in-jokes and shout-outs. At the end of the day, though, the plot was thin and the characters flat (though they could have done much worse by Peach). It's probably the best one could do with the source material, but that doesn't mean it's great
