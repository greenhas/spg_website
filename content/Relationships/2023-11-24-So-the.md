So, the thing is that I don't really love the genre of the classic Disney movie, and this suffers from a lot of the issues of that genre. As a somewhat self-indulgent anniversary celebration, though, I think it's a good homage to the past 100 years of Disney, blending the tropes of the genre with modern sensibilities and interesting animation.
