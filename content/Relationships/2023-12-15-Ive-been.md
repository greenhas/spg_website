I've been meaning to read (play?) this for months, ever since we bought it for kiddo after she recovered from being sick. Today, she's sick again, so we went through it together.

This continues to be a great series by Shiga! I might like the first one more, but only slightly. The Beyond is surprisingly thinky for a kid's book, has interesting puzzles, and there's a hidden ending that I know exists but need to figure out. I hope Shiga has plans for more of these.
