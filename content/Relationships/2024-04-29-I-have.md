I have a bunch of small complaints about this movie, but I came away from it generally feeling like it was well done, so I'm erring on the side of a more positive rating. I don't know if that makes me an uncritical movie watcher, but whatever.

For the most part, I liked the aesthetic choices! It bugged me that the spaceship was modeled after a space shuttle, because that doesn't make a ton of sense, but I did appreciate that the film went with shorthand in terms of set design instead of trying to make it realistic or whatever.

I also thought the premise of the movie was interesting. At the end of the day, I don't know if I agree with how things turned out for the characters, and I think the movie got a lot less interesting once they returned home. It was interesting to see the movie play with some compelling questions, though.

I could go on with nitpicks, and I suspect that some of those nitpicks would turn into bigger flaws if I really sat with them. It wasn't a bad way to spend a Saturday night, though.
