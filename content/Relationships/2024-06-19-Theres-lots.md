There's lots to like about this movie: a good message, some good jokes, and some animation gags that I really liked. It's hard to live up to the original film, though, and this just didn't feel as tight. Parts of the plot felt rushed, the internal logic of the first film wasn't as present, and it felt repetitive with some of the plot beats. I'm glad I saw it, but I think the first captures most of the magic that's here—and more besides.
