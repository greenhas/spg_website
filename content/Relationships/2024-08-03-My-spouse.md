My spouse has been trying to get me to read this book for ages. I've never been resistant to the idea, but I just never got around to it! Finally, I made some time this week to try it, and I see why she was so keen on it.

The sense of humor reminds me of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but whereas H2G2 is goofy to be goofy, this has a really cozy story and important message at the heart of it. The worldbuilding is subtle (to the point of ambiguous‚Äîmy spouse and I argued about where and when it was set), the characters are fun, and it's just a delight to read.
