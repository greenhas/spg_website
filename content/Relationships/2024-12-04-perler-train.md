Kiddo did lots of fuse bead art with cousins over Thanksgiving. When I complained that the train in the instruction manual was out of the 19th century and that kids' stuff never acknowledges awesome modern trains, she improvised this high speed beauty for me.

![A high speed train made out of perler beads. It kind of looks more like an American mail truck, but I like the idea of a world where the USPS operates high speed rail, so I'm not complaining.](/2024-12-04-perler-train.JPEG)
