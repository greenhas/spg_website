I don't think anything beats *The Wrong Trousers* in the Wallace and Gromit canon, but this could have been much worse as a follow-up to that classic. It's silly (mostly in good ways), subtly but wonderfully British, and kept kiddo laughing. It's the best Wallace and Gromit I've seen for a while, even if it isn't as good as the classic stuff.
