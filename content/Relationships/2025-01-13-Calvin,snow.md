For what it's worth, Calvin and Hobbes reruns also get me this morning.

![Calvin and Hobbes are standing in the snow. Calvin says "Some days you hey up and you already know that things aren't going to go well. They're the type of days when you should just give in, put your pajamas back on, make some hot chocolate, and read comic books in bed with the covers up until the world looks more encouraging.](/2025-01-13-Calvin,snow.JPEG)
