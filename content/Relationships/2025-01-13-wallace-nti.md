Well, at least some of today's comic strip characters *also* have a "non-traditional instruction" day.

![Comic strip characters are talking over walkie talkie (or, as the French say for some unfathomable reason, « talkie-walkie »). A voice over the radio asks what everyone is doing today. One character responds "probably just play video games." Another points out that they have an online class and asks if anyone is going to attend. The others all say no.](/2025-01-13-wallace-nti.JPEG)
