I don't think a kid's version of the show can compete with the sweary semi-sadism of the original, but I'm glad there was a series I could use to introduce a currently-too-young-for-all-that kiddo to the concept. Plus, the kids were cute and funny and most of the tasks genuinely enjoyable to watch.
