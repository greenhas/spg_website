summary: "This paper examines the use of social media to foster community connections within the MSU Urban Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) program. We describe the strategies employed by the program and the technologies employed by instructors to provide support, build community, and showcase learning. We highlight three particular tools used to foster community within the program: Facebook, websites and blogs, and Twitter and then use trace data from Twitter to demonstrate how social media fostered community within the program. We conclude with a description of implications for how social media is used to support community for future research and practice."
