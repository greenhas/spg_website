summary: "This chapter is an autoethnography of paradigm shift. By paradigm, I mean a collection of “understandings, methods, values, and expectations” (Kimmons & Johnstun, 2019, p. 631). Autoethnography is particularly well suited for exploring paradigm shift, given that its very practice is a deliberate argument for new scholarly paradigms (Ellis et al., 2011). Autoethnography’s philosophical underpinnings also explain my persistent interjection of the personal into what I myself expected to be a story about my professional life. To write an autoethnography is to accept that “canonical forms of doing and writing research” represent a “White, masculine, heterosexual, middle/upper-classed, Christian, able-bodied perspective” (Ellis et al., 2011, p. 3). It is, therefore, natural that I revisit my personal relationship with that perspective as I write this autoethnography about my professional life."
