This article may make its way into a chapter I'm writing on how assumptions about education shape our understanding of what appropriate data collection looks like. As Audrey Watters has written, this kind of thing is very much edtech, and we need to be critical about how we deploy it. Even if it did work, I'm not sure the surveillance would be worth it. If it doesn't work, all the more reason to be skeptical.
