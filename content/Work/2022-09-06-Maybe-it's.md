Maybe it's because of my area of research, but I think the headline here is misleading. Being a teacher on TikTok is one thing, and I'm not opposed to that. Putting your students on TikTok is entirely different, and I struggle to see that being ethically justified. Josh's research is absolutely the right reference point here.
