Just because some worries about ChatGPT are, indeed, moral panics doesn't mean that there aren't legtimate criticisms of the technologyâ€”including from an educational perspective. I happen to agree with Masnick that schools ultimately need to roll with the punches here, but given how much we already expect of our schools and teachers, it's reasonable to resent being punched in the first place. Masnick's point about the error rate for detecting AI-generated text is an important one, though: I don't think plagiarism-detecting surveillance is at all the right response.
