I have been looking for this kind of book for a long time, and some of my recent publications would have been stronger if this had come out in time for me to reference it beforehand. It's not perfect: Some wording is awkward and the conceptual framework (while interesting) could be stronger. However, it's invaluable for the history it offers and I expect to cite it regularly in the future.
