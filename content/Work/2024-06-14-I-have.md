I have tried to be open minded about this, and I am always hesitant to take a position on something that I haven't done all the homework on. I also agree with the point the president's made that staff, students, and non-tenure-track faculty don't have enough of a voice, so I'm open to changing what inclusive governance looks like at UK.

This doesn't seem to me to be it, though. Even without having done all the homework, the president's arguments don't land for me, and I don't see how removing the faculty's voice gives staff and students more of a voice. Even when the president outlines issues that I can get on board with, the solutions don't seem to fix those issues. I'm worried about what "nimbleness" might be a euphemism for, and I really don't want to find out.
