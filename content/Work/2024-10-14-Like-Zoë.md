Like Zoë Schiffer's *Extremely Hardcore*, I think this book will be even more valuable in the future than it is right now. I also wish I'd waited to read it for a bit instead of so soon after Schiffer's book!

What a wild, depressing story the Musk acquisition has been. I appreciate this book for giving more insight into the pre-Musk troubles of the company, but it still doesn't shy away from how disastrous one billionaire's ego has been.
