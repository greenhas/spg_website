On one hand, if the university's connections are tenuous, I can understand making the easy move to get the administration off our backâ€”especially when I'm confident that UK is pushing back against NIH indirect costs and other issues. On the other, I certainly hope that our response to every attack isn't going to be to roll over and wash our hands of things.
