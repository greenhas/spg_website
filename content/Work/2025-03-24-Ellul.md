This is an ambitious book‚Äîprobably overambitious, and I don't agree with all of the claims, especially with 60-70 years for Ellul's ideas to marinate in continued technological development. Yet, his ideas are valuable and prescient‚ÄîI don't buy his claims as an ontological argument, but I think they make for a compelling theoretical framework for making sense of lots of what's happening today.
