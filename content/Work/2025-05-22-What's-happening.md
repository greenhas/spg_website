title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: Funding Cuts Are a â€˜Gut Punchâ€™ for STEM Education Researchers"
---
What's happening at the NSF is a tragedy, and I'm upset about all of these cuts. That said, I've long been skeptical about how the NSF has been used to promote STEM education at the expense of other worthy (but less economically productive) causes in schools. If Trump's pettyâ€”and often cruelâ€”cuts are a warning sign about how government can distort research priorities, there's a deeper issue lurking in the background that we also need to wrestle with.
