I'm being a little hard on this book because it wasn't quite was I was expecting. There's a lot of good stuff in here despite not having some of what I was hoping to find. I do wonder if it would have been better as the original lecture it's based on: You could hear some of the audio, and I think some of the fat could be trimmed from the manuscript. I enjoyed reading it, I just wasn't wowed by it.
