Don't know what to say here except that I don't like any of this. Reminded of two arguments from Ellul:

* First, that an effective ethics of technology considers systematic effects, not "good" uses vs. "bad" uses,

* Second, that "because it exists" is not sufficient justification for adopting a technology.

Anyway, here's the [gift link](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/technology/chatgpt-teachers-openai-microsoft.html?unlocked_article_code=1.U08.Hy9e.xPKnL5hfW2Kv&smid=url-share).
