Okay, really don't want to spend any more time writing about Grok, but let's talk about this passage:

> "With respect to academic questions, Grok 4 is better than PhD level in every subject, no exceptions," Musk claimed during the livestream. We've previously covered nebulous claims about "PhD-level" AI, finding them to be generally specious marketing talk.

To return to my thoughts on AI and epistemology, I don't think having a PhD is (or should be) a benchmark for *content knowledge*. Rather, I think it demonstrates (or should demonstrate) a commitment to the process of knowledge production, and LLMs cannot truly compete with humans there.
