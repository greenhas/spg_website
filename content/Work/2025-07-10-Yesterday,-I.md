title: "ðŸ”— linkblog: Musk makes grand promises about Grok 4 in the wake of a Nazi chatbot meltdown"

Yesterday, I [wrote](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/on-grok-and-epistemology/) my thoughts on how Grok's "Nazi meltdown" helps illustrate some of my concerns about AI and epistemology. 

This coverage of Grok's latest demo only reinforces thatâ€”Musk's tinkering with the LLM to get the results he wants is at odds with his states naÃ¯ve epistemology that an LLM can be "maximally truth-seeking," as though there is a self-evident truth that an LLM can deliver in a straightforward way (that is, without all that mucking about behind the scenes).

I'm also reminded of Karen Hao's excellent *Empire of AI*, where she contrasts the lofty dreams ("discover new physics") and fears (e.g., rogue superintelligence) of AI companies  with their general refusal to confront the much more mundane problems these technologies create ("antisemitic tirades," as the article puts it.
