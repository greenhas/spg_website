I mostly skimmed this book, and I would have some quibbles with it if I got more into the details, but I found it really good. Musical theater is far, faaaar outside of my research interests, but this book articulates a fascinating "theology of voice" within Mormonism that will be helpful as I look to write something on Ellul and Mormon Studies.
