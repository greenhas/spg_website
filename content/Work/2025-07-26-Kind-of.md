Kind of hate that we have to ask the question in this headline! 

I've been (link)blogging recently about needing to talk about epistemology when we talk about generative AI. I know that in at least one case, I've evoked the generation of scientific knowledge as a counterexample to the "just the facts, ma'am" naÃ¯ve epistemology promoted by AI and its supporters. To use generative AI to review papersâ€”and to try to get around peer reviewâ€”feels particularly dangerous to me.
