Here's Jacques Ellul on state funding of research:

> The state demands that anything scientific enter into the line of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù development, not only for the stake of the public interest but also because of its will to power. We have previously noted that this will to power has found in technique an extraordinary means of expression. The state quickly comes to demand that technique keep its promises and be an effective servant of state power. Everything not of direct interest to this drive for power appears valueless.

I think Ellul's observation was true even under the old U.S. regime of state funding, but wow is it ever true now.
