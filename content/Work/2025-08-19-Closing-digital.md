Closing digital divides is good, and increasing diversity in tech fields as good, but I've been complaining for years about computer science ed that we stop at the nobility of those goals and don't ask ourselves about the deeper motivations behind those initiatives. So it is with AI: A more diverse field more available to all is better than what we have, but we also have to ask whether AI education is actually a social good.
