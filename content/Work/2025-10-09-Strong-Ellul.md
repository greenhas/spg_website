Strong Ellul vibes in this passage:

> The tech could represent the end of visual fact â€” the idea that video could serve as an objective record of reality â€” as we know it. Society as a whole will have to treat videos with as much skepticism as people already do words.

Unclear, though, whether Ellul would be cool with increased skepticism of the image or angry at the technology causing it.
