Honestly trying to figure out whether the reason I see Ellul everywhere is because I'm excited about a new scholar I've discovered or because his ideas are so well suited for the current moment. "We can be a leader or we can be left behind" captures the opt-in determinism of Ellul's technique so dang well.

Of course, how the heck am I going to keep expressing concern about AI (through an Ellulian lens or otherwise) if the university has already decided that we're all getting on board?
