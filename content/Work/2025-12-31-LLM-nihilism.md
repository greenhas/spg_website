Prepping one of my Spring courses, and I'm apparently so tired that I've just decided to appeal directly to my students' sense of
decency when it comes to respecting course policies on generative AI.

![A screenshot of my Canvas course that reads: "As with all assessments in this course, I will not accept writing that has been created by a generative Al tool. I do not believe in student surveillance, and Al detectors would be untrustworthy even if I did use them, so if you want to sneak some LLM-generated text by me, you might be able to get away with it-but please consider what that says about you as a student and a person. If I have compelling reason to believe that you have used generative Al tools in this assignment, I will reach out to you about it and penalize your work accordingly."](/2025-12-31-LLM-nihilism.JPEG)
