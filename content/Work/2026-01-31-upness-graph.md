Can't even start a lazy Saturday archive binge of a decades-old webcomic without coming back to Jacques Ellul, concerns about quantification and metrics, etc.

![A screencap from Shortpacked. Faz is brandishing a graph and says to Galasso: "Contrary to what he says, I have this graph that clearly shows a line going up." In the next panel, Ethan counters: "You don't even know what that graph represents!" Galasso replies that it "represents upness."](/2026-01-31-upness-graph.JPEG)
