I love hearing from former students about the great and interesting things that they're up to—and especially when something they learned in one of my classes helped them along the way. In my experience, former students who are up to great and interesting things would often be doing those things whether or not they had taken one of my classes, but I still appreciate feeling like my teaching contributed in some small way.

Today's edition of the University of Kentucky's news service, *[UKnow](https://uknow.uky.edu/)*, covered [some of the work](https://uknow.uky.edu/professional-news/library-science-alumna-uses-gamification-encourage-reading) being done by Sammie Betler, one of the School of Information Science's recent LIS grads who's currently working as the interim director of the [Casey County Public Library](https://www.caseylibrary.org/). Sammie was a student in my Spring 2022 LIS 618 course on games and learning, which she was kind enough to mention during her interview with folks here at UK. 

I loved having Sammie in class—her contributions to course activities and her dedication to her course projects were everything a professor hopes for from a student—and I'm glad that her great work is getting recognition from the university.
