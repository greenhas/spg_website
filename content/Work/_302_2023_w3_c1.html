# when editorial process goes wrong!

November 17, 2020 *New York Times* [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/world/europe/france-website-obituaries.html) by Aurelien Breeden: 

--

> *For a brief moment this week, startled readers of a French news site had to grapple with the apparent demise of Queen Elizabeth II of England; Pelé, the Brazilian soccer legend; Clint Eastwood; Brigitte Bardot; and dozens of other celebrities and world leaders.*

--

> *As it turned out, the website of Radio France Internationale had mistakenly published about 100 prewritten obituaries for prominent figures.*

--

> *Several hours after the obituaries first ran on Monday, the public radio station, which broadcasts in France and abroad, apologized and started taking the reports offline. It said unedited drafts had been accidentally published as it moved its website to a new content management system. Online platforms like Google and Yahoo News then automatically picked up some of the articles.*

February 28, 2022 *The Scotsman* [story](https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/russian-news-agency-appears-to-accidentally-publish-article-claiming-victory-3590253): 

--

> *It is the blunder feared by every news outlet that has pre-prepared articles written in the event of a sudden breaking story.*

--

> *For Russian state-run news agency RIA-Novosti, the error was arguably worse than many similar bloopers, when it published a comment piece [two days after the invasion] proclaiming Russian victory in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia.*

--

> *G/O’s early experiments with AI tools began on Wednesday through a couple of articles appearing on Gizmodo and The AV Club credited to the publications’ respective bots. And almost immediately, there were embarrassing mistakes.*

--

> *The Gizmodo bot’s first story, “A Chronological List of Star Wars Movies & TV Shows,” contained factual errors about the in-universe chronology of the franchise, something fans were quick to point out.*

--

> *James Whitbrook, a deputy editor of *io9*, where the story appeared, tweeted that he was unaware the article would be published until shortly before. Whitbrook also said that “no one at *io9* played a part in its editing or publication.”*

> *There simply is no single skill of “cooking.” If you say, “I can cook!” what are you saying? It’s not like you stand there and then just…cook. It’s not binary like you’re just “cooking” or “not cooking.”*

## five roles in Barker's *Web Content Management*:

--

* ### editors
* ### site planners
* ### developers 
* ### administrators
* ### stakeholders

--

# 🎩🧢👒🎓

---

# editors


> *A CMS user responsible for performing editorial process to create, edit, or otherwise manage content. An editor creates, manages, edits, approves, and publishes content. This is considered the core user of a CMS. Most CMS functionality is based around editors.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/editor/)

--

### subtypes:

* power editor
* approver
* community manager / content moderator
* marketer

---

# site planners

--

> *Site planners are responsible for designing the website the CMS will manage. Most of their involvement will be prior to launch, with sporadic further involvement as the site develops and changes over time.* 

Deane Barker, *Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices*, p. 56

---

# developers

--

> *The role responsible for installing, configuring, extending, and templating a CMS implementation.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/developer/)

--

### subtypes:

* front-end developers (work with HTML/CSS and templates)
* back-end developers (work with the CMS itself and extensions)

---

# administrator

--

> *A role responsible for managing the settings, users, permissions, and other configurable functionality of a CMS. This role manages the system itself, not the content within it.*

--

> *The person in the administrator role is often also a power editor, and occasionally one of the implementing developers.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/administrator/)

---

# stakeholder

--

> *A role which does not interact directly with the CMS but is primarily concerned with the results the CMS is intended to bring about.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/stakeholder/)

---
# workflow

--

> *An framework to move content through a defined set or map of specific steps, activities, or tasks.*

--

> *The content can only be “in” one such state for a particular workflow at a time. When that state resolves, content will “move” to another state, and continue until the workflow ends.*

Deane Barker, [Flying Squirrel Glossary](https://flyingsquirrelbook.com/glossary/term/workflow/)

## what did the Star Wars workflow look like? 

--

## what did Madeline's workflow look like?

--

## other examples?

---

# we need a workflow!

--

## over the next few weeks, we will be making decisions about our Hugo site's:

--

* ### structure

--

* ### presentation (including themes)

--

* ### aggregation (including menus, tags, etc.)

--

* ### among others!
