<p>BA in French Teaching; PhD in Educational Technology; Associate Professor of ICT at University of Kentucky School of Information Science</p>

<p>I am an interdisciplinary digital methods researcher studying meaning-making practices on online platforms. Most of my work has dealt with informal learning through social media, but I'm increasingly dabbling in online Mormonism, the online far right, and various combinations of the three.</p>
