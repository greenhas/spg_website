On Thursday morning, I presented some work I've been doing with Dan Krutka at a session of the Association of Educational Communications and Technology. Here's the title and abstract of our presentation:

## Teachers on Far-Right Social Media: The Dark Side of Affinity Spaces for Informal Learning

> We present the results of our studying a teachers’ group on a far-right social media platform. The identity of the platform and the persistence of far-right agenda setting overwhelmed any educational intentions of the group, which therefore had little to offer teachers looking to improve their craft. Our findings offer an opportunity to revisit theoretical frameworks and other perspectives that are common in the literature on teachers’ use of social media.

My slides for the presentation can be found [here](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/_aect_2023_gab.html#1), and I'd be happy to take any questions about the presentation!
