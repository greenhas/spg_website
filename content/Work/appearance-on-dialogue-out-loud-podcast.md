One of my most recent articles—a [piece](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-publication-technology-naming-and-legitimacy-in-the-latter-day-saint-tradition/) on technology, naming, and legitimacy in the Latter-day Saint tradition—was published in *Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought*. Publishing in *Dialogue* has been a wonderful opportunity. It's a niche journal, so it may never reach the breadth of audience that I usually aim for in publishing. However, that niche focus has also come with a number of benefits. I want to write more about this soon, but the purpose of this post is just to draw attention to one of these benefits: the in-house podcast(s) produced by the *Dialogue* team. 

A number of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to sit down with *Dialogue* editor Taylor Petrey (whose 2020 book [*Tabernacles of Clay: Sexuality and Gender in Modern Mormonism*](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469656229/tabernacles-of-clay/) is a must-read) to talk about my recent article. A few days ago, that conversation was released as [the most recent episode](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/podcasts/the-true-domain-name-of-the-church-a-conversation-with-spencer-p-greenhalgh/) of the *Dialogue Out Loud* podcast. Listening to it now, it's clear that I was having the beginning of some microphone problems that I wouldn't realize for another few weeks. I wish I had recorded with a slightly different setup, but I hope that the episode is still helpful for giving an overview of the article (which is itself [still available](https://www.dialoguejournal.com/articles/the-correct-domain-name-of-the-church-technology-naming-and-legitimacy-in-the-latter-day-saint-tradition/#pdf-wrap) through open access).
