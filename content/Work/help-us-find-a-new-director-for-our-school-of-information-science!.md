Jeff Huber, the longtime Director of the School of Information Science at the University of Kentucky, is stepping down into a regular faculty role at the end of this academic year. I'm serving on the search committee to find a new Director, and I'm happy to share that the [official posting](https://ukjobs.uky.edu/postings/427648) for the job is now live. If this sounds up your alley, feel free to apply, and if this isn't your kind of job, please help share the posting with folks who might be interested. We're a friendly, multidisciplinary, and unique unit, and we're looking for just the right person to fit our mission and culture. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
