title: "job post: instructional communication lecturer position at University of Kentucky"
tags: ["job post","instructional communication"]

My unit (the School of Information Science) at the University of Kentucky teaches all of the composition and communication courses for the College of Communication and Information, and I just received word this morning that we're hiring a full-time lecturer for these courses. I feel conflicted about the existence of the lecturer position at UK, but I can say with some fconfidence that lecturers are valued, respected members of the SIS faculty. Details about the post are available [here](https://ukjobs.uky.edu/postings/407323).
