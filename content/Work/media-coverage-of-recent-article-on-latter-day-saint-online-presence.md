I recently [wrote](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-publication-technology-naming-and-legitimacy-in-the-latter-day-saint-tradition/) about a new article of mine in *Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought* where I trace the history of the official domain names of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This past week, I was lucky enough for the fine folks at the Salt Lake Tribune to take interest in the article. Peggy Fletcher Stack wrote a summary of my findings in this (unfortunately paywalled) [article](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/04/16/how-lds-church-worked-worked-paid/), which appeared on Sunday. Later in the week, I got to sit down with Peggy and Dave Noyce for their excellent *Mormon Land* podcast. That episode is freely available (i.e., no paywall), and can be listened to [here](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/04/19/mormon-land-churchs-internet/).

Peggy and Dave do great work, and it was a real honor to be able to share my research with them. This is arguably one of the more obscure articles I've written: Folks who appreciate it from a technical perspective might not follow all the Mormon details, and not everyone who follows Mormon news is interested in the Domain Name System. This was an excellent exercise in communicating my research for a general audience, and I'm grateful for the Tribune's invitation to do so.
