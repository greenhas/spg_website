Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the 2022 meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion to present research with [Amy Chapman](https://www.amylchapman.com/) on how the reactionary DezNat movement on Mormon Twitter conceptualizes and claims—but ultimately problematizes—religious authority in the online sphere. We presented in one of the sessions sponsored by the Mormon Social Science Association and were lucky enough to have some good conversations and receive some helpful feedback. 

Our presentation slides can be found at [this link](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/_mssa_2022_deznat.html#1) and reviewed in the browser. You can use arrow keys to move back and forth in the presentation and hit `p` to toggle presenter mode (and see our presentation notes). Naturally, we welcome any further feedback: Our first paper on the DezNat movement (a more general overview) is now in press with the Journal of the Mormon Social Science Association, and we're looking forward to turning this more specific exploration of religious authority into a follow-up paper sometime soon.
