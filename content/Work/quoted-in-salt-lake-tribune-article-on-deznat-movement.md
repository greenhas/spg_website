This past weekend, Peggy Fletcher Stack at the *Salt Lake Tribune* published [an article](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/07/30/why-dismissing-all-deznat-users/) about the #DezNat movement on Mormon Twitter, which takes cues from far-right and anti-feminist online communities. In her article, Peggy was kind enough to reference (and quote from) [my new publication](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/far-right-and-anti-feminist-influences-on-a-mormon-twitter-hashtag/) with Amy Chapman in the *Journal of the Mormon Social Science Association*, which presents the (partial) results of a qualitative analysis of over 1,400 DezNat tweets from 2019. 

I especially appreciated this quote of mine that Peggy included, because it gets at one of the most important points in the work Amy and I have done: 

> Though the movement has been associated with ultraconservative politics, Chapman and Greenhalgh found many of the posts were aimed at gender and women’s issues.
> 
> “A lot of conversations and complaints I’ve heard about DezNat focus on questions of politics and race, but it was clear to Amy and me that gender and sexuality were also major themes in DezNat postings,” Greenhalgh says. “That’s especially important because, while the church has encouraged members to take steps against racism and has condemned white nationalism and political violence, it’s harder to tell whether the church would disapprove of the aggressive stances on gender and sexuality that we saw in our posts.”

The article is paywalled, but if you're a subscriber (or [a Patreon supporter](https://www.patreon.com/mormonland) of their religion coverage, which I've found indispensible), I'd be interested in hearing your feedback!
