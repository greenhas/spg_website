This last weekend, I made a brief appearance in an [article from the Salt Lake Tribune](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2025/02/16/how-social-media-is-shaping-latter/) discussing the influence of social media on Mormon masculinity. As I've noted before, the Tribune aggressively paywalls, but it's hard to fault them. I get access to their religion coverage by paying $3/month to the Patreon for their *Mormon Land* podcast.

My appearance is brief—a simple mention that Jordan Peterson is mentioned a number of times in a forum site I'm studying with colleagues—but those colleagues (Levi Sands at the University of Iowa and Amy Chapman at Arizona State) have more to say about the unsurprising, ambiguous, and worrying overlap between figures like Peterson and Andrew Tate and online Mormonism. Indeed, the article later quotes one Mormon influencer as describing "Guys like Andrew Tate" as "colleagues of mine," and the influencer in particular is a familiar face from the work Amy and I have done on the DezNat movement from Mormon Twitter.

I'm glad the Tribune is doing work like this, and it's giving me ideas for what to study next!
