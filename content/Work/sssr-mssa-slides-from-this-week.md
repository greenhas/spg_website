A few hours after [presenting at AECT](/aect-slides-from-this-week) on Thursday morning, I hopped on a plane to Salt Lake City, so that I could attend the 2023 conference of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religionâ€”especially the sessions associated with the Mormon Social Science Association. I'm giving three presentations today and wanted to include my slides here for anyone else who's interested: I'd be happy to talk more about any of these!

## Christian nationalism in official communication from the far-right social media platform Gab.

In [this presentation](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/_sssr_2023_gab.html#1), I'll be talking about my work in progress analyzing references to religion (and especially Christian nationalism) in blog posts authored by Gab CEO Andrew Torba. 

## "This is not an official site": Theological speculation and discussion on the LDS Freedom Forum.

Levi Sands is the lead author on this (Amy Chapman and I are providing backup), and [we'll be presenting](https://ldsands.github.io/Slides/MainSlides/OneOffPresentations/2023_10_23_Levi_Sands_SSSR_This_Is_Not_An_Official_Site.html) on how participants on a right-wing Latter-day Saint forum discuss the theology behind polygamy.

##  Navigating boundaries in Mormon spaces on far-right social media.

This is another [solo presentation](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/_mssa_2023_lds_gab.html#1) from me, where I'll be discussing Mormonism-focused groups on the Gab social media platform and how they define and navigate boundaries between themselves and various groups.
