A few months ago, [I announced](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-publication-documenting-a-teacher-group-on-far-right-social-media/) a new publication from Dan Krutka and me based on our study of a teacher's group on far-right social media. I'm happy to share that Renee Hobbs's Media Education Lab has taken interest in the research, and that Dan and I will be giving a webinar for them next month.

The webinar is called "When Teachers Talk Politics Online: The Dark Side of Online Spaces for Teacher Professional Learning" and will take place on October 6th at 4pm EST. It is free, but you need to register [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/NceyFucMRQqxZAsLHlFtbw) to get the Zoom link.
