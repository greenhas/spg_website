<p>I've provided a few different ways to follow the content I publish here without having to come back to the website on a regular basis to see what's new.</p>

<h1>RSS</h1>

<p>I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> to be one of the best and most important web technologies out there; here's <a href="https://spencergreenhalgh.com/myself/2024-10-16-rss-forever/">Cory Doctorow's excellent argument</a> in favor of using RSS readers to follow web content. If you want to subscribe to any of my content through RSS, here are some helpful links:

<ul>
<li><a href="/index.xml">all content on this website</a></li>
<li><a href="/tags/micro/index.xml">all microblog posts</a></li>
<li><a href="/tags/link/index.xml">all linkblog posts</a></li>
<li><a href="/myself/index.xml">all <em>Myself</em> content</a> (i.e., personal interests and projects)</li>
<li><a href="/relationships/index.xml">all <em>Relationships</em> content</a> (i.e., family life and friendships)</li>
<li><a href="/work/index.xml">all <em>Work</em> content</a> (i.e., teaching and research)</li>
<li><a href="/communities/index.xml">all <em>Communities</em> content</a> (i.e., politics and religion)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can even get more specific than this! I try to use consistent and regular tags in my writing. If you're interested in a particular subject, head to the <a href="/tags/">tags</a> page of this website and bring up one of the tags. Then add <code>index.xml</code> to the end of the URL and pop that into a feedreader to subscribe to only the posts on that subject.</p>

<h1>Mastodon</h1>

<p>Mastodon is an open-source, federated social media platform that allows users to set up distinct <em>instances</em> that can (usually) communicate with each other. I've been interested in this idea for a long time and think it keeps what I like about platforms like Twitter while getting rid of some of the problems inherent to big, powerful platforms (I like Cory Doctorow's write-up <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/make-social-media-work-better-make-it-fail-better-0">here</a>.)</p>

<p>I also run a private Mastodon instance at <a href="https://mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com">mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com</a> with accounts that relay the posts from the distinct sections of my website:</p>

<ul>
<li><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com/@spg_myself" >@spg_myself@mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com</a> relays my <em>Myself</em> posts</li>
<li><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com/@spg_relationships">@spg_relationships@mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com</a> relays my <em>Relationships</em> posts</li>
<li><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com/@spg_work">@spg_work@mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com</a> relays my <em>Work</em> posts</li>
<li><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com/@spg_communities">@spg_communities@mastodon.spencergreenhalgh.com</a> relays my <em>Communities</em> posts</li>
</ul>

<h1>Bluesky</h1>

<p>In the new social media landscape, I think that Mastodon best captures what I think social media <em>ought</em> to look like. I'm glad that Bluesky has provided a place for folks to find another alternative to Twitter, though, and <em>all</em>of my posts get forwarded to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spencergreenhalgh.com">@spencergreenhalgh.com</a>.</p>

<h1>Newsletter</h1>

<p>I also offer a <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> newsletter that provides a weekly(ish?) digest of the content that I post here.</a></p> 

<form
  action="https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/spgreenhalgh"
  method="post"
  target="popupwindow"
  onsubmit="window.open('https://buttondown.email/spgreenhalgh', 'popupwindow')"
