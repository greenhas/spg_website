## Introduction

Two weeks ago, we learned about importing a dataset into R. However, sometimes the dataset that we've found isn't precisely the data that we need. In this walkthrough, we'll practice *wrangling* data and *tidying* data—two skills that help us transform the data we have into the data we want. 

## Wrangling

In this section, we'll cover a series of functions from the `dplyr` package for data wrangling that will allow you to take a data frame and "wrangle" it (transform it) to suit your needs. Such functions include:

1. `filter()` a data frame's existing rows to only pick out a subset of them.
1. `mutate()` its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, convert hourly temperature recordings from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.
1. `arrange()` its rows. For example, sort rows of a dataframe in ascending or descending order of a particular variable.
1. `select()` a data frame's existing columns to only pick out a subset of them.
1. `rename()` the columns of a data frame
1. return the `top_n()` values of a particular variable

Notice how I've used `computer_code` font to describe the actions we want to take on our data frames. This is because the `dplyr` package for data wrangling has intuitively verb-named functions that are easy to remember. 

There is a further benefit to learning to use the `dplyr` package for data wrangling: its similarity to the database querying language [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (pronounced "sequel" or spelled out as "S", "Q", "L"). SQL (which stands for "Structured Query Language") is used to manage large databases quickly and efficiently and is widely used by many institutions with a lot of data. While SQL is a topic left for a book or a course on database management, keep in mind that once you learn `dplyr`, you can learn SQL easily. We'll talk more about their similarities in Subsection \@ref(normal-forms).

### Needed packages {-#wrangling-packages}

Let's load all the packages needed for our wrangling practice (this assumes you've already installed them). If needed, read Section \@ref(packages) for information on how to install and load R packages.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# Packages needed internally, but not in text.
library(kableExtra)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(scales)
```


### The pipe operator: `%>%` {#piping}

Before we start data wrangling, let's first introduce a nifty tool that gets loaded with the `dplyr` package: the \index{operators!pipe} pipe operator `%>%`. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in R into a single sequential *chain* of actions.

Let's start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame `x` using hypothetical functions `f()`, `g()`, and `h()`:

1. Take `x` *then*
1. Use `x` as an input to a function `f()` *then*
1. Use the output of `f(x)` as an input to a function `g()` *then*
1. Use the output of `g(f(x))` as an input to a function `h()`

One way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
h(g(f(x)))
```

This code isn't so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: `f()`, then `g()`, then `h()`; furthermore, each of these functions has a short name—and only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. 

This is where the pipe operator `%>%` comes in handy. `%>%` takes the output of one function and then "pipes" it to be the input of the next function. With this in mind, one helpful trick is to read `%>%` as "then" or "and then." For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
x %>% 
  f() %>% 
  g() %>% 
  h()
```

You would read this sequence as:

1. Take `x` *then*
1. Use this output as the input to the next function `f()` *then*
1. Use this output as the input to the next function `g()` *then*
1. Use this output as the input to the next function `h()`

While both approaches (nested parentheses and pipes) achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. But what are the hypothetical `x`, `f()`, `g()`, and `h()`?  Throughout this walkthrough on data wrangling:

1. The starting value `x` will be a data frame. For example, the \index{R packages!nycflights13} `flights` data frame we explored in Section \@ref(nycflights13).
1. The sequence of functions, here `f()`, `g()`, and `h()`, will mostly be a sequence of any number of the data wrangling verb-named functions we listed in the introduction to this walkthrough
1. The result will be the transformed/modified data frame that you want.

### `filter` rows {#filter}

```{r filter, fig.cap="Diagram of filter() rows operation.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("images/cheatsheets/filter.png")
```

The \index{dplyr!filter} `filter()` function here works much like the "Filter" option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variable in your dataset and then filter out only the rows that match that criteria.

Let's see what I mean by taking the `flights` dataset that we've used in the past and turning it into a slimmer dataset that includes only flights from New York City to Portland, Oregon.  The `dest` destination code (or airport code) for Portland, Oregon is `"PDX"`. Run the following and look at the results in RStudio's spreadsheet viewer to ensure that only flights heading to Portland are chosen here:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
portland_flights <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "PDX")
View(portland_flights)
```

Note the order of the code. First, take the `flights` data frame `flights` *then* `filter()` the data frame so that only those where the `dest` equals `"PDX"` are included. We test for equality using the double equal sign \index{operators!==} `==` and not a single equal sign `=`. Trying to run `filter(dest = "PDX")` will yield an error. This is a convention across many programming languages, but if you are new to coding, you'll probably forget to use the double equal sign `==` a few times before you get the hang of it. (To be honest, it's taken me more than a few times to get into this habit!)

You can use other operators \index{operators} beyond just the `==` operator that tests for equality:

- `>` corresponds to "greater than"
- `<` corresponds to "less than"
- `>=` corresponds to "greater than or equal to"
- `<=` corresponds to "less than or equal to"
- `!=` corresponds to "not equal to." The `!` is used in many programming languages to indicate "not"

Furthermore, you can combine multiple criteria using operators that make comparisons:

- `|` corresponds to "or"
- `&` corresponds to "and"

To see many of these in action, let's filter `flights` for all rows that departed from JFK *and* were heading to Burlington, Vermont (`"BTV"`) or Seattle, Washington (`"SEA"`) *and* departed in the months of October, November, or December. Run the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
btv_sea_flights_fall <- flights %>% 
  filter(origin == "JFK" & (dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA") & month >= 10)
View(btv_sea_flights_fall)
```

Note that even though we might say "all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont *and* Seattle, Washington" to another human, for a computer to understand, we have to specify that we really mean "all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont *or* leaving Seattle, Washington." For a given row in the data, `dest` can be `"BTV"`, or `"SEA"`, or something else, but not both `"BTV"` and `"SEA"` at the same time. Furthermore, note the careful use of parentheses around `dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA"`.

We can often skip the use of `&` and just separate our conditions with a comma. The previous code will return the identical output `btv_sea_flights_fall` as the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
btv_sea_flights_fall <- flights %>% 
  filter(origin == "JFK", (dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA"), month >= 10)
View(btv_sea_flights_fall)
```

Let's present another example that uses the \index{operators!not} `!` "not" operator to pick rows that *don't* match a criteria. As mentioned earlier, the `!` can be read as "not." Here we are filtering rows corresponding to flights that didn't go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
not_BTV_SEA <- flights %>% 
  filter(!(dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA"))
View(not_BTV_SEA)
```

Again, note the careful use of parentheses around the `(dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA")`. If we didn't use parentheses, like with the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights %>% filter(!dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA")
```

We would be returning all flights not headed to `"BTV"` *or* those headed to `"SEA"`, which is an entirely different resulting data frame. 

Now say we have a larger number of airports we want to filter for, say `"SEA"`, `"SFO"`, `"PDX"`, `"BTV"`, and `"BDL"`. We could continue to use the `|` (*or*) \index{operators!or} operator:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
many_airports <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "SEA" | dest == "SFO" | dest == "PDX" | 
         dest == "BTV" | dest == "BDL")
```

but as we progressively include more airports, this will get unwieldy to write. A slightly shorter approach uses the `%in%` \index{operators!in} operator along with the `c()` function. Recall from Subsection \@ref(programming-concepts) that the `c()` function "combines" or "concatenates" values into a single *vector* of values. \index{vectors}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
many_airports <- flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% c("SEA", "SFO", "PDX", "BTV", "BDL"))
View(many_airports)
```

What this code is doing is filtering `flights` for all flights where `dest` is in the vector of airports `c("BTV", "SEA", "PDX", "SFO", "BDL")`. Both outputs of `many_airports` are the same, but as you can see the latter takes much less energy to code. The `%in%` operator is useful for looking for matches commonly in one vector/variable compared to another.

As a final note, we recommend that `filter()` should often be among the first verbs you consider applying to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about, or put differently, it narrows down the scope of your data frame to just the observations you care about. 

### `mutate` existing variables {#mutate}

```{r select, fig.cap="Diagram of mutate() columns.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE, out.height='80%', out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("images/cheatsheets/mutate.png")
```

Another common transformation of data is to create/compute new variables based on existing ones. For example, say you are more comfortable thinking of temperature in degrees Celsius (&deg;C) instead of degrees Fahrenheit (&deg;F). The formula to convert temperatures from &deg;F to &deg;C is

$$
\text{temp in C} = \frac{\text{temp in F} - 32}{1.8}
$$

We can apply this formula to the `temp` variable using the `mutate()` \index{dplyr!mutate()} function from the `dplyr` package, which takes existing variables and mutates them to create new ones. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
weather <- weather %>% 
  mutate(temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8)
```

In this code, we `mutate()` the `weather` data frame by creating a new variable `temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8` and then *overwrite* the original `weather` data frame. Why did we overwrite the data frame `weather`, instead of assigning the result to a new data frame like `weather_new`? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing original information that you might need later, it's acceptable practice to overwrite existing data frames with updated ones, as we did here. On the other hand, why did we not overwrite the variable `temp`, but instead created a new variable called `temp_in_C`?  Because if we did this, we would have erased the original information contained in `temp` of temperatures in Fahrenheit that may still be valuable to us.

Let's consider another example. Passengers are often frustrated when their flight departs late, but aren't as annoyed if, in the end, pilots can make up some time during the flight.  This is known in the airline industry as _gain_, and we will create this variable using the `mutate()` function:

```{r}
flights <- flights %>% 
  mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay)
```

Let's take a look at only the `dep_delay`, `arr_delay`, and the resulting `gain` variables for the first 5 rows in our updated `flights` data frame in Table \@ref(tab:first-five-flights).

```{r first-five-flights, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  select(dep_delay, arr_delay, gain) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "First five rows of departure/arrival delay and gain variables"
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "hold_position")
```

The flight in the first row departed 2 minutes late but arrived 11 minutes late, so its "gained time in the air" is a loss of 9 minutes, hence its `gain` is 2 - 11 = -9. On the other hand, the flight in the fourth row departed a minute early (`dep_delay` of -1) but arrived 18 minutes early (`arr_delay` of -18), so its "gained time in the air" is $-1 - (-18) = -1 + 18 = 17$ minutes, hence its `gain` is +17.

To close out our discussion on the `mutate()` function to create new variables, note that we can create multiple new variables at once in the same `mutate()` code. Furthermore, within the same `mutate()` code we can refer to new variables we just created. As an example, consider the `mutate()` code Wickham and Grolemund (2017) show in [Chapter 5](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) of *R for Data Science*:

```{r}
flights <- flights %>% 
  mutate(
    gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
    hours = air_time / 60,
    gain_per_hour = gain / hours
  )
```

### `arrange` and sort rows {#arrange}

One of the most commonly performed data wrangling tasks is to sort a data frame's rows in the alphanumeric order of one of the variables. The `dplyr` package's `arrange()` function \index{dplyr!arrange()} allows us to sort/reorder a data frame's rows according to the values of the specified variable.

Suppose we are interested in determining the most frequent destination airports for all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013:

```{r}
freq_dest <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(num_flights = n())
freq_dest
```

Observe that by default the rows of the resulting `freq_dest` data frame are sorted in alphabetical order of `dest`ination. Say instead we would like to see the same data, but sorted from the most to the least number of flights (`num_flights`) instead:

```{r}
freq_dest %>% 
  arrange(num_flights)
```

This is, however, the opposite of what we want. The rows are sorted with the least frequent destination airports displayed first. This is because `arrange()` always returns rows sorted in ascending order by default. To switch the ordering to be in "descending" order instead, we use the `desc()` \index{dplyr!desc()} function as so:

```{r}
freq_dest %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_flights))
```

### `select` variables {#select}

```{r selectfig, fig.cap="Diagram of select() columns.", echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("images/cheatsheets/select.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This redundant code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
# :: operator used as output was wrong otherwise
flights_cols <- nycflights13::flights %>%
  ncol() 
```

We've seen that the `flights` data frame in the `nycflights13` package contains `r flights_cols` different variables. You can identify the names of these `r flights_cols` variables by running the `glimpse()` function from the `dplyr` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
glimpse(flights)
```

However, say you only need two of these `r flights_cols` variables, say `carrier` and `flight`. You can `select()` \index{dplyr!select()} these two variables:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  select(carrier, flight)
```

This function makes it easier to explore large datasets since it allows us to limit the scope to only those variables we care most about. For example, if we `select()` only a smaller number of variables as is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:selectfig), it will make viewing the dataset in RStudio's spreadsheet viewer more digestible.

Let's say instead you want to drop, or de-select, certain variables. For example, consider the variable `year` in the `flights` data frame. This variable isn't quite a "variable" because it is always `2013` and hence doesn't change. Say you want to remove this variable from the data frame. We can deselect `year` by using the `-` sign:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights_no_year <- flights %>% select(-year)
```

Another way of selecting columns/variables is by specifying a range of columns:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flight_arr_times <- flights %>% select(month:day, arr_time:sched_arr_time)
flight_arr_times
```

This will `select()` all columns between `month` and `day`, as well as between `arr_time` and `sched_arr_time`, and drop the rest. 

The `select()` function can also be used to reorder columns when used with the `everything()` helper function.  For example, suppose we want the `hour`, `minute`, and `time_hour` variables to appear immediately after the `year`, `month`, and `day` variables, while not discarding the rest of the variables. In the following code, `everything()` will pick up all remaining variables: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights_reorder <- flights %>% 
  select(year, month, day, hour, minute, time_hour, everything())
glimpse(flights_reorder)
```

Lastly, the helper functions `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, and `contains()` can be used to select variables/columns that match those conditions. As examples,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights %>% select(starts_with("a"))
flights %>% select(ends_with("delay"))
flights %>% select(contains("time"))
```


### `rename` variables {#rename}

Another useful function is \index{dplyr!rename()} `rename()`, which as you may have guessed changes the name of variables. Suppose we want to only focus on `dep_time` and `arr_time` and change `dep_time` and `arr_time` to be `departure_time` and `arrival_time` instead in the `flights_time` data frame:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights_time_new <- flights %>% 
  select(dep_time, arr_time) %>% 
  rename(departure_time = dep_time, arrival_time = arr_time)
glimpse(flights_time_new)
```

Note that in this case we used a single `=` sign within the `rename()`. For example, `departure_time = dep_time` renames the `dep_time` variable to have the new name `departure_time`. This is because we are not testing for equality like we would using `==`. Instead we want to assign a new variable `departure_time` to have the same values as `dep_time` and then delete the variable `dep_time`. Note that new `dplyr` users often forget that the new variable name comes before the equal sign. <!-- We usually remember this as "New Before, Old After" or NBOA. -->


### `top_n` values of a variable

We can also return the top `n` values of a variable using the `top_n()` \index{dplyr!top\_n()} function. For example, we can return a data frame of the top 10 destination airports in the dataframe we've already established. Observe that we set the number of values to return to `n = 10` and `wt = num_flights` to indicate that we want the rows corresponding to the top 10 values of `num_flights`. See the help file for `top_n()` by running `?top_n` for more information. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights_time_new %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights)
```

Let's further `arrange()` these results in descending order of `num_flights`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flights_time_new  %>% 
  top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_flights))
```

## Tidying Data

```{r setup_tidy, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# Used to define Learning Check numbers:
chap <- 4
lc <- 0

# Set R code chunk defaults:
opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  eval = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE,
  message = TRUE,
  tidy = FALSE,
  purl = TRUE,
  out.width = "\\textwidth",
  fig.height = 4,
  fig.align = "center"
)

# Set output digit precision
options(scipen = 99, digits = 3)

# In kable printing replace all NA's with blanks
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")

# Set random number generator see value for replicable pseudorandomness.
set.seed(76)
```

In Subsection \@ref(programming-concepts), I introduced the concept of a \index{data frame} data frame in R: a rectangular spreadsheet-like representation of data where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables describing each observation.  In Section \@ref(nycflights13), we started exploring our first data frame: the `flights` data frame included in the `nycflights13` package. 

In the first section of this walkthrough, we learned how to take existing data frames and transform/modify them to suit our ends. In this second section, we extend some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called "tidy" data. You will see that having data stored in "tidy" format is about more than just what the everyday definition of the term "tidy" might suggest: having your data "neatly organized." Instead, we define the term "tidy" as it's used by data scientists who use R, outlining a set of rules by which data is saved.

Knowing about tidy data was not necessary earlier because all the data we used were already in "tidy" format. In this walkthrough, we'll now see that this format is essential to using the tools we've covered. Furthermore, it will also be useful for future walkthroughs as we cover future ideas.

### Needed packages {-#tidy-packages}

Let's load all the packages needed for this walkthrough (this assumes you've already installed them). If needed, read Section \@ref(packages) for information on how to install and load R packages.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(nycflights13)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(here)
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# Packages needed internally, but not in text.
library(kableExtra)
library(stringr)
library(scales)
```

### Importing data {#csv}

Up to this point, most of our activities have used data stored inside of an R package, though we *have* practiced importing data from an outside source in Section \@ref(loading-dataset). It's time to put that practice to use!

To practice tidying data, we need to load a *Comma Separated Values* `.csv` \index{CSV file} file, the same format that I encouraged you to find for your personal dataset.  You can think of a `.csv` file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where:

* Each line in the file corresponds to one row of data/one observation.
* Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas in each row.
* The first line is often, but not always, a *header* row indicating the names of the columns/variables.

The `.csv` file we're interested in here is `dem_score.csv`—it is found in the `activity_data` subfolder of your class project folder and contains ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992. Let's use the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package (with some help from the `@here` package) to read it from your computer, import it into R, and save it in a data frame called `dem_score`.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(readr)
dem_score <- read_csv(here("activity_data","dem_score.csv"))
dem_score
```


In this `dem_score` data frame, the minimum value of `-10` corresponds to a highly autocratic nation, whereas a value of `10` corresponds to a highly democratic nation. Note also that backticks surround the different variable names.  Variable names in R by default are not allowed to start with a number nor include spaces, but we can get around this fact by surrounding the column name with backticks. We'll revisit the `dem_score` data frame in a case study in the upcoming Section \@ref(case-study-tidy).

Note that the `read_csv()` function included in the `readr` package is different than the `read.csv()` function that comes installed with R. While the difference in the names might seem trivial (an `_` instead of a `.`), the `read_csv()` function is, in our opinion, easier to use since it can more easily read data off the web and generally imports data at a much faster speed. Furthermore, the `read_csv()` function included in the `readr` saves data frames as `tibbles` by default. 

### "Tidy" data {#tidy-data-ex}

With our data imported, let's learn about the concept of "tidy" data format with a motivating example from the `fivethirtyeight` package. The `fivethirtyeight` package provides access to the datasets used in many articles published by the data journalism website, [FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). For a complete list of all `r nrow(data(package = "fivethirtyeight")[[3]])` datasets included in the `fivethirtyeight` package, check out the package webpage by going to: <https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/articles/fivethirtyeight.html>.\index{R packages!fivethirtyeight}

Let's focus our attention on the `drinks` data frame and look at its first 5 rows:

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
drinks %>%
  head(5)
```

After reading the help file by running `?drinks`, you'll see that `drinks` is a data frame containing results from a survey of the average number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed in `r drinks %>% nrow()` countries. This data was originally reported on FiveThirtyEight.com in Mona Chalabi's article: ["Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/).

Let's apply some of the data wrangling verbs we learned in Section \@ref(wrangling) on the `drinks` data frame:

1. `filter()` the `drinks` data frame to only consider 4 countries: the United States, China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, *then*
1. `select()` all columns except `total_litres_of_pure_alcohol` by using the `-` sign, *then*
1. `rename()` the variables `beer_servings`, `spirit_servings`, and `wine_servings` to `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`, respectively.

and save the resulting data frame in `drinks_smaller`:

```{r}
drinks_smaller <- drinks %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("USA", "China", "Italy", "Saudi Arabia")) %>% 
  select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) %>% 
  rename(beer = beer_servings, spirit = spirit_servings, wine = wine_servings)
drinks_smaller
```

Let's compare this way of organizing the data with an alternative:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
drinks_smaller_tidy <- drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = -country)
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

```{r echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This redundant code is used for dynamic non-static in-line text output purposes
n_row_drinks <- drinks_smaller_tidy %>% nrow()
n_alcohol_types <- drinks_smaller_tidy %>%
  select(type) %>%
  n_distinct()
n_countries <- drinks_smaller_tidy %>%
  select(country) %>%
  n_distinct()
```

Observe that while `drinks_smaller` and `drinks_smaller_tidy` are both rectangular in shape and contain the same `r n_row_drinks` numerical values (`r n_alcohol_types` alcohol types by `r n_countries` countries), they are formatted differently. `drinks_smaller` is formatted in what's known as \index{wide data format} ["wide"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) format, whereas `drinks_smaller_tidy` is formatted in what's known as ["long/narrow"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data#Narrow) format.

In the context of doing data science in R, long/narrow format \index{long data format} is also known as "tidy" format. In order to use the packages that we prefer in this class, your input data frames *must* be in "tidy" format. Thus, all non-"tidy" data must be converted to "tidy" format first. Before we convert non-"tidy" data frames like `drinks_smaller` to "tidy" data frames like `drinks_smaller_tidy`, let's define "tidy" data.

### Definition of "tidy" data {#tidy-definition}

You have surely heard the word "tidy" in your life:

* "Tidy up your room!"
* "Write your homework in a tidy way so it is easier to provide feedback."
* Marie Kondo's best-selling book, [_The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing_](https://www.powells.com/book/-9781607747307), and Netflix TV series [_Tidying Up with Marie Kondo_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80209379).
* "I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - 'Read me, please!'" - Linda Grant

What does it mean for your data to be "tidy"? While "tidy" has a clear English meaning of "organized," the word "tidy" in data science using R means that your data follows a standardized format. We will follow Hadley Wickham's (2014) definition of *"tidy" data*  shown also in Figure \@ref(fig:tidyfig):

> A *dataset* is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings AKA text data (if qualitative/categorical). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes.
> 
> "Tidy" data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In *tidy data*:
>
> 1. Each variable forms a column.
> 2. Each observation forms a row.
> 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

(ref:tidy-r4ds) Tidy data graphic from *R for Data Science*.

```{r tidyfig, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:tidy-r4ds)", out.height="80%", out.width="80%", purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("images/r4ds/tidy-1.png")
```

For example, say you have the following table of stock prices in Table \@ref(tab:non-tidy-stocks):

```{r non-tidy-stocks, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
stocks <- tibble(
  Date = as.Date("2009-01-01") + 0:4,
  `Boeing stock price` = paste("$", c("173.55", "172.61", "173.86", "170.77", "174.29"), sep = ""),
  `Amazon stock price` = paste("$", c("174.90", "171.42", "171.58", "173.89", "170.16"), sep = ""),
  `Google stock price` = paste("$", c("174.34", "170.04", "173.65", "174.87", "172.19"), sep = "")
) %>%
  slice(1:2)
stocks %>%
  kable(
    digits = 2,
    caption = "Stock prices (non-tidy format)",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
```

Although the data are neatly organized in a rectangular spreadsheet-type format, they do not follow the definition of data in "tidy" format. While there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (date, stock name, and stock price), there are not three columns. In "tidy" data format, each variable should be its own column, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:tidy-stocks). Notice that both tables present the same information, but in different formats. 

```{r tidy-stocks, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
stocks_tidy <- stocks %>%
  rename(
    Boeing = `Boeing stock price`,
    Amazon = `Amazon stock price`,
    Google = `Google stock price`
  ) %>%
  #  gather(`Stock name`, `Stock price`, -Date)
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Date,
    names_to = "Stock Name",
    values_to = "Stock Price"
  )
stocks_tidy %>%
  kable(
    digits = 2,
    caption = "Stock prices (tidy format)",
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
```

Now we have the requisite three columns Date, Stock Name, and Stock Price. On the other hand, consider the data in Table \@ref(tab:tidy-stocks-2).

```{r tidy-stocks-2, echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
stocks <- tibble(
  Date = as.Date("2009-01-01") + 0:4,
  `Boeing Price` = paste("$", c("173.55", "172.61", "173.86", "170.77", "174.29"), sep = ""),
  `Weather` = c("Sunny", "Overcast", "Rain", "Rain", "Sunny")
) %>%
  slice(1:2)
stocks %>%
  kable(
    digits = 2,
    caption = "Example of tidy data" # ,
    #    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ifelse(is_latex_output(), 10, 16),
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
```

In this case, even though the variable "Boeing Price" occurs just like in our non-"tidy" data in Table \@ref(tab:non-tidy-stocks), the data *is* "tidy" since there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information: Date, Boeing price, and the Weather that particular day.

### Converting to "tidy" data

In our walkthroughs so far, you've only seen data frames that were already in "tidy" format. Furthermore, for the rest of this book, you'll mostly only see data frames that are already in "tidy" format as well. However, this is not always the case with all datasets—including, perhaps, the dataset that you've chosen to work with for your class proejcts. If your original data frame is in wide (non-"tidy") format and you would like to use the packages we learn about, you will first have to convert it to "tidy" format. To do so, we recommend using the \index{tidyr!pivot\_longer()} `pivot_longer()` function in the `tidyr` package. 

Going back to our `drinks_smaller` data frame from earlier:

```{r}
drinks_smaller
```

We convert it to "tidy" format by using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package as follows:

```{r}
drinks_smaller_tidy <- drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = -country)
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

We set the arguments to `pivot_longer()` as follows:

1. `names_to` here corresponds to the name of the variable in the new "tidy"/long data frame that will contain the *column names* of the original data. Observe how we set `names_to = "type"`. In the resulting `drinks_smaller_tidy`, the column `type` contains the three types of alcohol `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`. Since `type` is a variable name that doesn't appear in `drinks_smaller`, we use quotation marks around it. You'll receive an error if you just use `names_to = type` here.
1. `values_to` here is the name of the variable in the new "tidy" data frame that will contain the *values* of the original data. Observe how we set `values_to = "servings"` since each of the numeric values in each of the `beer`, `wine`, and `spirit` columns of the `drinks_smaller` data corresponds to a value of `servings`. In the resulting `drinks_smaller_tidy`, the column `servings` contains the `r n_countries` $\times$ `r n_alcohol_types` = `r n_row_drinks` numerical values. Note again that `servings` doesn't appear as a variable in `drinks_smaller` so it again needs quotation marks around it for the `values_to` argument.
1. The third argument `cols` is the columns in the `drinks_smaller` data frame you either want to or don't want to "tidy." Observe how we set this to `-country` indicating that we don't want to "tidy" the `country` variable in `drinks_smaller` and rather only `beer`, `spirit`, and `wine`. Since `country` is a column that appears in `drinks_smaller` we don't put quotation marks around it.

The third argument here of `cols` is a little nuanced, so let's consider code that's written slightly differently but that produces the same output: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = c(beer, spirit, wine))
```

Note that the third argument now specifies which columns we want to "tidy" with `c(beer, spirit, wine)`, instead of the columns we don't want to "tidy" using `-country`. We use the `c()` function to create a vector of the columns in `drinks_smaller` that we'd like to "tidy." Note that since these three columns appear one after another in the `drinks_smaller` data frame, we could also do the following for the `cols` argument:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
drinks_smaller %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "type", 
               values_to = "servings", 
               cols = beer:wine)
```

Converting "wide" format data to "tidy" format often confuses new R users. The only way to learn to get comfortable with the `pivot_longer()` function is with practice, practice, and more practice using different datasets. For example, run `?pivot_longer` and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file. We'll show another example of using `pivot_longer()` to convert a "wide" formatted data frame to "tidy" format in Section \@ref(case-study-tidy). 


#### `nycflights13` package

Recall the `nycflights13` package with data about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013. Let's revisit the `flights` data frame by running `View(flights)`. We saw that `flights` has a rectangular shape, with each of its `r flights %>% nrow() %>% comma()` rows corresponding to a flight and each of its `r flights %>% ncol()` columns corresponding to different characteristics/measurements of each flight. This satisfied the first two criteria of the definition of "tidy" data from Subsection \@ref(tidy-definition): that "Each variable forms a column" and "Each observation forms a row." But what about the third property of "tidy" data that "Each type of observational unit forms a table"?

Recall that we saw in Subsection \@ref(exploredataframes) that the observational unit for the `flights` data frame is an individual flight. In other words, the rows of the `flights` data frame refer to characteristics/measurements of individual flights. Also included in the `nycflights13` package are other data frames with their rows representing different observational units:

* `airlines`: translation between two letter IATA carrier codes and airline company names (`r airlines %>% nrow()` in total). The observational unit is an airline company.
* `planes`: aircraft information about each of `r planes %>% nrow() %>% comma()` planes used, i.e., the observational unit is an aircraft.
* `weather`: hourly meteorological data (about `r weather %>% count(origin) %>% .[["n"]] %>% mean() %>% round() %>% comma()` observations) for each of the three NYC airports, i.e., the observational unit is an hourly measurement of weather at one of the three airports.
* `airports`: airport names and locations. The observational unit is an airport.

The organization of the information into these five data frames follows the third "tidy" data property: observations corresponding to the same observational unit should be saved in the same table, i.e., data frame. You could think of this property as the old English expression: "birds of a feather flock together." 

### Case study: Democracy in Guatemala {#case-study-tidy}

In this section, we'll show you another example of how to convert a data frame that isn't in "tidy" format ("wide" format) to a data frame that is in "tidy" format ("long/narrow" format). We'll do this using the `pivot_longer()` function from the `tidyr` package again. 

Let's use the `dem_score` data frame we imported in Section \@ref(csv), but focus on only data corresponding to Guatemala.

```{r}
guat_dem <- dem_score %>% 
  filter(country == "Guatemala")
guat_dem
```

Let's lay out the grammar of graphics we saw in Section \@ref(grammarofgraphics). 

Now we are stuck in a predicament, much like with our `drinks_smaller` example in Section \@ref(tidy-data-ex). We see that we have a variable named `country`, but its only value is `"Guatemala"`.  We have other variables denoted by different year values.  Unfortunately, the `guat_dem` data frame is not "tidy."

We need to take the values of the columns corresponding to years in `guat_dem` and convert them into a new "names" variable called `year`. Furthermore, we need to take the democracy score values in the inside of the data frame and turn them into a new "values" variable called `democracy_score`. Our resulting data frame will have three columns:  `country`, `year`, and `democracy_score`. Recall that the `pivot_longer()` function in the `tidyr` package does this for us:

```{r}
guat_dem_tidy <- guat_dem %>% 
  pivot_longer(names_to = "year", 
               values_to = "democracy_score", 
               cols = -country,
               names_transform = list(year = as.integer)) 
guat_dem_tidy
```

We set the arguments to `pivot_longer()` as follows:

1. `names_to` is the name of the variable in the new "tidy" data frame that will contain the *column names* of the original data. Observe how we set `names_to = "year"`.  In the resulting `guat_dem_tidy`, the column `year` contains the years where Guatemala's democracy scores were measured.
1. `values_to` is the name of the variable in the new "tidy" data frame that will contain the *values* of the original data. Observe how we set `values_to = "democracy_score"`. In the resulting `guat_dem_tidy` the column `democracy_score` contains the 1 $\times$ 9 = 9 democracy scores as numeric values.
1. The third argument is the columns you either want to or don't want to "tidy." Observe how we set this to `cols = -country` indicating that we don't want to "tidy" the `country` variable in `guat_dem` and rather only variables `1952` through `1992`. 
1. The last argument of `names_transform` tells R what type of variable `year` should be set to. Without specifying that it is an `integer` as we've done here, `pivot_longer()` will set it to be a character value by default.


## `tidyverse` package {#tidyverse-package}

At the beginning of our tidying walkthrough, we loaded the following three packages (as well as `here`), which are among the most frequently used R packages for data science:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```

Recall that `dplyr` is for data wrangling, `readr` is for importing spreadsheet data into R, and `tidyr` is for converting data to "tidy" format. There is a much quicker way to load these packages than by individually loading them: by installing and loading the `tidyverse` package. The `tidyverse` package acts as an "umbrella" package whereby installing/loading it will install/load multiple packages at once for you. 

After installing the `tidyverse` package as you would a normal package (as seen in Section \@ref(packages)), running:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

would be the same as running:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
```

We'll cover `ggplot2` in a future walkthrough, and the `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats` are left for a more advanced book; check out [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) to learn about these packages.

For the remainder of this book, we'll start every walkthrough by running `library(tidyverse)`, instead of loading the various component packages individually. The `tidyverse` "umbrella" package gets its name from the fact that all the functions in all its packages are designed to have common inputs and outputs: data frames are in "tidy" format. This standardization of input and output data frames makes transitions between different functions in the different packages as seamless as possible. For more information, check out the [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/) webpage for the package.
