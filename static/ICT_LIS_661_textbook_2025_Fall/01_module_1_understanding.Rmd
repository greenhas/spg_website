## Required Materials

This course uses a free custom online textbook based on Creative Commons-licensed works such as [*Data Feminism*](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/), OpenStax's [*Introductory Statistics()](https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics), and the "ModernDive" [*Statistical Inference Via Data Science*](https://moderndive.com/) textbook. 

## "Life is Difficult" Statement [inspired by [Dr. Andrew Heiss]

Recent years have been characterized by a global pandemic, increased (and overdue) attention to inequalities and injustices, and stressful political tensions; we might hope that the worst of all of these has passed, but the truth is that none of them have disappeared. This can be a difficult time to be in grad school.

**Despite these difficulties, I am fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class!** My late policy and willingness to make accommodations are generous even during normal times, and if your life is being turned upside down, I'm willing to be as flexible as you need me to be—so long as you are active in communicating with me.

If you feel like you're behind, not understanding everything, or just plain stressed, **do not suffer in silence**! I'm usually quick to respond to email and more than happy to meet with you.

## Basic Needs Statement [inspired by Dr. [Sara Goldrick-Rab](https://medium.com/@saragoldrickrab/basic-needs-security-and-the-syllabus-d24cc7afe8c9)]

Any student who has difficulty affording or accessing food to eat every day or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to [contact the Dean of Students](http://www.uky.edu/concern/) and to explore the resources listed at the bottom of [this page](https://uknow.uky.edu/campus-news/uk-working-ensure-food-and-housing-security-among-students). Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable in doing so.

## Course Information

### Course Description

This course will provide a foundation in the area of data science based on data curation and statistical analysis. The primary goal of this course is for students to learn data analysis concepts and techniques that facilitate making decisions from a rich data set. Students will investigate data concepts, metadata creation and interpretation, the general linear model, cluster analysis, and basics of information visualization. At the beginning, this course will introduce fundamentals about data and data standards and methods for organizing, curating, and preserving data for reuse. Then, we will focus on the inferential statistics: drawing conclusions and making decisions from data. This course will help students understand how to use data analysis tools, and especially, provide an opportunity to utilize an open source data analysis tool, R, for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Finally, in this course we will discuss diverse issues around data including technologies, behaviors, organizations, policies, and society. 

### Course Objectives—"I Can Statements"

The following "I can" statements will guide all of the learning and assessment activities throughout this course. Although these objectives have some overlap, activities within each module will clearly and specifically relate to a single objective, and larger assessments will implicitly ask you to demonstrate all of them. As we proceed throughout the semester, you should feel increasingly comfortable making these statements about yourself:

* I can express my understanding of philosophical, ethical, statistical, research, and other concepts underpinning data science.
* I can apply that understanding—in conjunction with R programming—to completing practical projects.
* I can connect conceptual and practical elements of data science to disciplinary and contextual knowledge.

### Course Assessment

Your grade for this course will be based on 100 points: 

* 90 points – 100.0 points = A
* 80 points – 89.9 points = B
* 70 points – 79.9 points = C
* 0 points – 69.9 points = E

These 100 points come from the following assessment activities, which should all be completed honestly and individually on Canvas:

#### Projects

Throughout the semester, you will complete four projects worth a total of 55 points:

* Project #1: Finding and Evaluating Data (10 points)
* Project #2: Exploring and Describing Data (10 points)
* Project #3: Building and Evaluating Models (10 points)
* Final Project: Reporting Data Analysis (25 points)

Detailed instructions for these projects can be found on Canvas.

#### Participation

Throughout the semester, you will earn 45 points from a series of participation activities. During each of the fifteen modules of the semester, you will complete three reading or participation activities (each worth one point) that will help you extend or apply your understanding of course content; while these activities vary from module to module, a plurality of modules involve annotating a reading from the textbook, completing a programming walkthrough with provided data, and then adapting (some of) the code from the walkthrough to work with your own data.

### Late Work Policy

Officially, each assignment is due at 11:59pm on the Sunday night indicated in Canvas. Practically speaking, however, I will grade without penalty (for graded assessments) and provide feedback on (for all assessments) anything that is turned in by the time I begin reviewing that assessment. However, I will not grade or provide feedback on any work that is completed after this time unless you have made other arrangements with me. Naturally, because my schedule varies from week to week and because I try to provide feedback as quickly as possible, your best bet is to turn in your work by the official deadline or—if life has thrown you a curveball—to get in touch with me ahead of time to make other arrangements.

### Prep Week

[UK policies](https://ombud.uky.edu/students/academic-policies/prep-days-reading-days) limit what I can assign during Week 16 of the course. However, I am "permitted to grade student participation," "collect regularly assigned homework," and "collect projects" so long as those assignments are scheduled ahead of time and, in the case of projects, there is nothing due during Finals Week. Please note that your final project meets these requirements and is due during Week 16.


## Course Policies

All of the policies listed on [this page](https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/acadpolicy) are in effect for this course. 

## Code, Plagiarism, and Generative AI 

It is common practice in data science and programming communities to borrow code from other, more knowledgeable programmers. Indeed, many of the weekly activities in this class will explicitly involve copying or adapting code from our textbook, and you might find online or other sources helpful for figuring out how to complete a specific task for your class projects. When done properly, this is not plagiarism—in fact, it is good practice in data science.

**Nonetheless, you are ultimately responsible for completing assessments**, and plagiarism remains a serious concern for this course. Thus, [these rules](https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/ao) related to academic offenses are also in effect for this course, and I will not tolerate their violation. If you consult other sources, please ensure that they support (rather than replace) your personal work, effort, initiative, and understanding. It is **your responsibility** to ensure that you understand what plagiarism is and how to avoid it; when in doubt, reach out to me with your questions.

Along these lines, I **strongly discourage** you from using any generative AI tool to write code or text for you. AI-generated output can include errors, and as a general rule, if you know enough to catch those errors, you know enough to generate that output yourself; conversely, generating that output yourself will help you further develop your knowledge more than relying on a tool. If you do use any generative AI in completing your work, you **must explicitly acknowledge it** in your submission—and you will assume responsibility for any errors the tool makes.

# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Students can confidentially report alleged incidences through the Violence Intervention and Prevention Center (https://www.uky.edu/vipcenter), Counseling Center (https://www.uky.edu/counselingcenter), or University Health Service (https://ukhealthcare.uky.edu/university-health-service/student-health). 

Reports of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct may be made to Institutional Equity [here](https://www.uky.edu/universitysenate/).

### Office of LGBTQ* Resources 

UK is committed to supporting students and upholding the University’s efforts to promote inclusion among our community. UK faculty and staff employees support inclusion and diversity throughout the University, including the ways in which faculty structure classroom conversations and manage those dynamics. To assist in these efforts, students are welcome to provide the names and pronouns they prefer. One easy way to do this is by using the pronoun feature of UK’s Name Change Form. (More information about the form can be found on the Office of LGBTQ*’s website (https://uky.edu/lgbtq/forms-and-resources). Otherwise, students can provide this information to instructors directly.

Discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identity is prohibited at UK. If you have questions about support, advocacy, and community-building services related to sexual orientation, gender expression, or gender identity, students are encouraged to visit the website of the Office of LGBTQ* Resources (https://uky.edu/lgbtq/forms-and-resources).

### Veterans Resource Center (VRC) 

Being both a member of the military community and a student can bring some complexities. If you are a member of the military or a military veteran or dependent, please let instructors know when these challenges arise. Drill schedules, calls to active duty, mandatory training exercises, issues with GI Bill disbursement, etc. can complicate your academic life. Let your instructor know if you experience complications.

The VRC is a great resource for members of our military family. If you have questions regarding your VA benefits or other related issues, the VRC has a full complement of staff to assist you. The VRC also provides study and lounge space, as well as free printing. Please visit the VRC website (https://uky.edu/veterans), email the VRC (vetcenter@uky.edu), visit them in the basement of Erikson Hall, or call the director, Colonel Tony Dotson, at (859) 257-1148.

If you are a military student serving in the National Guard or Reserve, it is in your best interest to let all of your instructors know that immediately. You might also consider sharing a copy of your training schedule. 

If you are a military student who is a member of the National Guard or Military Reserve and are called to duty for one-fifth or less of this semester, provide a copy of your military orders to the Director of the Veterans Resource Center (contact information above) once you become aware of the call to duty. (Please also provide the Director with a list of all your current courses and instructors.) The Director will verify the orders with the appropriate military authority and will, on the military student's behalf, notify their instructors as to the known extent of the absence.

Your absences will not be penalized and instructors will work with military students to create reasonable accommodations for making up missed assignments, quizzes, and tests.

### Violence Intervention and Prevention (VIP) Center 

If you experience an incident of sex- or gender-based discrimination or interpersonal violence, we encourage you to report it. While you may talk to a faculty member or TA/RA/GA, understand that as a "Responsible Employee" of the University these individuals MUST report any acts of violence (including verbal bullying and sexual harassment) to the University's Title IX Coordinator in the Institutional Equity Office. If you would like to speak with someone who may be able to afford you confidentiality, you can visit the Violence Intervention and Prevention (VIP) Center’s website (https://uky.edu/vipcenter/content/faq) (offices located in Bosworth Hall, 1st Floor; (859) 257-3574), the Counseling Center’s (CC) website (https://uky.edu/counselingcenter/student-resources), and the University Health Services (UHS) website (https://uky.edu/university-health-service/student-health/our-student-services). The VIP Center, CC, and UHS are confidential resources on campus. **The VIP Center accepts Zoom, phone, and walk-in appointments**.
