You will complete the Module 15 Application activity on Canvas. Please navigate to the corresponding discussion board and respond to the following prompt:

> Most weeks this semester, our *application* activity focused on getting hands-on practice with the tools of data scienceâ€”usually related to the R programming language or related software. The purpose of these activities was to give you experience with **working** like a data scientist. In this discussion board, post a 1-2 paragraph post where you reflect on what you learned from these activities, what questions you still have, and where you'll take these ideas in the future!
