# M15C: Reflect on Your Connection of Data Science

You will complete the Module 15 Connection activity on Canvas. Please navigate to the corresponding discussion board and respond to the following prompt:

> Most weeks this semester, our connection activity focused on translating the conceptual and practical aspects of data science to a particular context—usually a personal or professional context of your choosing. One common (and well-founded) criticism of data scientists is that they too often live in the world of statistics and programming and don't fully understand the context that they're trying to apply data science to—the purpose of these activities was therefore to help you be contextually aware in a way that many data scientists aren't. In this discussion board, post a 1-2 paragraph post where you reflect on what you learned from these activities, what questions you still have, and where you'll take these ideas in the future!
