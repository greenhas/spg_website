Phone—859.218.2294 Email—spencer.greenhalgh@uky.edu (preferred) Zoom—https://uky.zoom.us/my/greenhalgh 2.1.4 Response Time During the work week (but not the weekend!), I commit to respond to all emails within 24 hours. I expect you to regularly check Canvas and email for messages from me and to respond quickly. 2.1.5 Office Hours I will hold office hours in person or on Zoom (see above): Wednesday, 9am to 11am Thursday, 1pm to 3pm, or by appointment While you are free to come by without an appointment, I suggest that you let me know when you plan to come to office hours. 2.1.6 Meeting Schedule This course takes place asynchronously on Canvas 2.2 Required Materials This course uses a free custom online textbook based on Creative Commons-licensed works such as Data Feminism, OpenStax’s Introductory Statistics, and the “ModernDive” Statistical Inference Via Data Science textbook. 2.3 “Life is Difficult” Statement [inspired by [Dr. Andrew Heiss] Recent years have been characterized by a global pandemic, increased (and overdue) attention to inequalities and injustices, and stressful political tensions; we might hope that the worst of all of these has passed, but the truth is that none of them have disappeared. This can be a difficult time to be in grad school—and it may be more difficult for some individuals and groups than others. Despite these difficulties, I am fully committed to making sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class! My late policy and willingness to make accommodations are generous even during normal times, and if your life is being turned upside down, I’m willing to be as flexible as you need me to be—so long as you are active in communicating with me. If you feel like you’re behind, not understanding everything, or just plain stressed, do not suffer in silence! I’m usually quick to respond to email and more than happy to meet with you. 2.4 Basic Needs Statement [inspired by Dr. Sara Goldrick-Rab] Any student who has difficulty affording or accessing food to eat every day or who lacks a safe and stable place to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Center for Support and Intervention. Furthermore, if you are comfortable doing so, you can also notify me. The following resources are also available at the University of Kentucky: Mental Health Resources Academic Support Disability Resource Center Academic Ombud 2.5 Course Information 2.5.1 Course Description This course will provide a foundation in the area of data science based on data curation and statistical analysis. The primary goal of this course is for students to learn data analysis concepts and techniques that facilitate making decisions from a rich data set. Students will investigate data concepts, metadata creation and interpretation, the general linear model, cluster analysis, and basics of information visualization. At the beginning, this course will introduce fundamentals about data and data standards and methods for organizing, curating, and preserving data for reuse. Then, we will focus on the inferential statistics: drawing conclusions and making decisions from data. This course will help students understand how to use data analysis tools, and especially, provide an opportunity to utilize an open source data analysis tool, R, for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Finally, in this course we will discuss diverse issues around data including technologies, behaviors, organizations, policies, and society. 2.5.2 Course Objectives—“I Can Statements” The following “I can” statements will guide all of the learning and assessment activities throughout this course. Although these objectives have some overlap, activities within each module will clearly and specifically relate to a single objective, and larger assessments will implicitly ask you to demonstrate all of them. As we proceed throughout the semester, you should feel increasingly comfortable making these statements about yourself: I can express my understanding of philosophical, ethical, statistical, research, and other concepts underpinning data science. I can apply that understanding—in conjunction with R programming—to completing practical projects. I can connect conceptual and practical elements of data science to disciplinary and contextual knowledge. 2.5.3 Course Assessment Your grade for this course will be based on 100 points: 90 points – 100.0 points = A 80 points – 89.9 points = B 70 points – 79.9 points = C 0 points – 69.9 points = E These 100 points come from the following assessment activities, which should all be completed honestly and individually on Canvas: 2.5.3.1 Projects Throughout the semester, you will complete four projects worth a total of 55 points: Project #1: Finding and Evaluating Data (10 points) Project #2: Exploring and Describing Data (10 points) Project #3: Building and Evaluating Models (10 points) Final Project: Reporting Data Analysis (25 points) Detailed instructions for these projects can be found on Canvas. 2.5.3.2 Participation Throughout the semester, you will earn 45 points from a series of participation activities. During each of the fifteen modules of the semester, you will complete three reading or participation activities (each worth one point) that will help you extend or apply your understanding of course content; while these activities vary from module to module, a plurality of modules involve annotating a reading from the textbook, completing a programming walkthrough with provided data, and then adapting (some of) the code from the walkthrough to work with your own data. 2.5.4 Late Work Policy Officially, each assignment is due at 11:59pm on the Sunday night indicated in Canvas. Practically speaking, however, I will grade without penalty (for graded assessments) and provide feedback on (for all assessments) anything that is turned in by the time I begin reviewing that assessment. However, I will not grade or provide feedback on any work that is completed after this time unless you have made other arrangements with me. Naturally, because my schedule varies from week to week and because I try to provide feedback as quickly as possible, your best bet is to turn in your work by the official deadline or—if life has thrown you a curveball—to get in touch with me ahead of time to make other arrangements. 2.5.5 Prep Week UK policies limit what I can assign during Week 16 of the course. However, I am “permitted to grade student participation,” “collect regularly assigned homework,” and “collect projects” so long as those assignments are scheduled ahead of time and, in the case of projects, there is nothing due during Finals Week. Please note that your final project meets these requirements and is due during Week 16. 2.6 Course Policies All of the policies listed on this page are in effect for this course. 2.7 Plagiarism, Cheating, and Generative AI 2.7.1 Plagiarism [source] “All academic work, written or otherwise, submitted by students to their instructors or other academic supervisors, is expected to be the result of their own thought, research or self-expression. In cases where students feel unsure about a question of plagiarism involving their work, they are obliged to consult their instructors on the matter before submission. When students submit work purporting to be their own, but which in any way borrows ideas, organization, wording or content from another source without appropriate acknowledgment of the fact, the students are guilty of plagiarism. “Plagiarism includes reproducing someone else’s work (including, but not limited to a published article, a book, a website, computer code or a paper from a friend) without clear attribution. Plagiarism also includes the practice of employing or allowing another person to alter or revise the work which a student submits as their own, whoever that other person may be, except under specific circumstances (e.g. Writing Center review, peer review) allowed by the Instructor of Record or that person’s designee. Plagiarism may also include double submission, self-plagiarism or unauthorized resubmission of one’s own work, as defined by the instructor. “Students may discuss assignments among themselves or with an instructor or tutor, except where prohibited by the Instructor of Record (e.g. individual take-home exams). However, the actual work must be done by the student, and the student alone, unless collaboration is allowed by the Instructor of Record (e.g. group projects). When a student’s assignment involves research in outside sources or information, the student must carefully acknowledge exactly what, where and how they have employed them. If the words of someone else are used, the student must put quotation marks around the passage in question and add an appropriate indication of its origin. Making simple changes while leaving the organization, content and phraseology intact is plagiaristic. However, nothing in this AR shall apply to those ideas which are so generally and freely circulated as to be a part of the public domain.” 2.7.2 Cheating [source] “Cheating is defined by its general usage. It includes, but is not limited to, the wrongfully giving, taking or presenting any information or material by a student with the intent of aiding themself or another on any academic work which is considered in any way in the determination of the final grade. “The fact that a student could not have benefited from an action is not by itself proof that the action does not constitute cheating.” 2.7.3 Code, Plagiarism, and Generative AI It is common practice in data science and programming communities to borrow code from other, more knowledgeable programmers. Indeed, many of the weekly activities in this class will explicitly involve copying or adapting code from our textbook. While I prefer that you draw from the textbook when borrowing code from other sources, you might also find online or other sources helpful for figuring out how to complete a specific task for your class projects. When done properly, this is not plagiarism or cheating—in fact, it is good practice in data science. Nonetheless, you are ultimately responsible for completing assessments, and plagiarism and cheating remain a serious concern for this course. If you consult other sources, please ensure that they support (rather than replace) your personal work, effort, initiative, and understanding. It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand what plagiarism is and how to avoid it; when in doubt, reach out to me with your questions. Along these lines, I strongly discourage you from using any generative AI tool (including ChatGPT, Claude, Llama, Gemini, or Grok) to write code or text for you. AI-generated output can include errors, and as a general rule, if you know enough to catch those errors, you know enough to generate that output yourself. Furthermore, there are multiple different “styles” of coding in R, and I’m intentionally trying to teach you one particular style; even if a generative AI tool returns “correct” code for you, it may give you code that isn’t compatible with the style that we’re focusing on in this class. This isn’t a huge deal, but it will get in the way of your learning, and that’s the most important point I can make here: Generating output yourself (and asking humans like me for help when you run into trouble) will help you develop your knowledge more than relying on a tool. If you do use any generative AI in completing your work, you must explicitly acknowledge it in your submission—and you will assume responsibility for any errors the tool makes. Students who use generative AI output in their work without acknowledging it will be penalized. 2.8 Course Schedule 2.8.1 Module 1: Course Introduction (25 Aug - 31 Aug) read and annotate the course syllabus complete “Install R and RStudio” walkthrough introduce yourself to the class 2.8.2 Module 2: Data Science (1 Sep - 7 Sep) read and annotate “The New(?) and Shiny(?)

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0. 3.1 Introduction My formal training is in education, so I have some strong opinions about what learning looks like and what good teaching ought to look like. In particular, I hold to a sociocultural view of learning that assumes that: knowledge is distributed in the world among individuals, the tools, artifacts, and books that they use, and the communities and practices in which they participate (Greeno et al., 1996, p. 20) In other words, I can’t teach you data science by merely rattling off a list of facts for you to memorize and then repeat at the appropriate time. Rather, if I’m going to effectively teach you data science, I need to introduce you to data science communities, have you use the tools that data scientists use, and have you act in the way that data scientists act. In relation to this second point, R and RStudio are software that are widely used in the world of data science, so becoming familiar with them is part of learning data science. Some data scientists prefer other software, and that’s fine, but this is what we’ve decided on teaching here in UK’s School of Information Science (and it’s what I personally use, so I’m better suited to teaching it anyway). This activity is about introducing you to this software and helping you set it up. Even if you have a pre-existing installation of R or RStudio, I highly recommend that you re-install both and get as current as possible. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new. 3.2 R R is an open source programming language designed for statistics. Two things are important about that initial description: First, R is open source, meaning that is freely available and that other programmers may add to it or modify it to their heart’s content. This is good news—it means that in addition to the basic features of R, it is possible (and relatively easy) to add new features by installing and loading packages. We’ll be doing plenty of that this semester. Second, R is designed for statistics. That doesn’t mean it can’t be used for other things: In my research, I regularly use R, but I rarely use it for traditional statistics. Nonetheless, R is built with statistical needs and tasks in mind. You can (and should now) install R from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system (as opposed to the source code). Follow the link for your operating system at the CRAN link in this paragraph. (You’ll probably notice that version names for R are… eccentric!). 3.3 RStudio Programming in R can be done in a number of ways, but in this class, we’ll be using an IDE (integrated development environment) called RStudio (developed by an organization called Posit). To download RStudio Desktop, navigate to this this link. It will provide you with a link for downloading R; since you’ve already done that, you can ignore it. What you shouldn’t ignore, though, is the link it will provide to download RStudio for your computer’s operatins system. It’s important to understand that RStudio is one of many interfaces available for working with the R programming language. Another interface (simply called R) will also be installed on your computer as a result of installing the R language, and it will be possible to open R code in either the R interface or the RStudio interface. Make sure that you always open code in RStudio—not only do I find it cleaner and easier to work with code there, but RStudio also has some extra features that we’ll be using throughout the semester. 3.4 References Greeno, J., Collins, A., &amp; Resnick, L.

Please navigate to the corresponding discussion board and respond to the following prompt: One of the hardest parts about teaching online classes is getting to know my students! For this week’s connection activity, please introduce yourself to me and to your classmates. You might include details like your pronouns, what program you’re in, your current (or expected future) job, and what you like to do for fun. I’d also be interested to hear why you’re taking this class, what you’re hoping to learn, and any big questions or concerns that you have. As with all discussion posts in this course, I strongly encourage you to read over and respond to what your classmates have posted. However, as important as meaningful interaction is, I’m skeptical that it can be structured or required, so I will never require you to do so. That said, I do expect that you will make an effort to contribute to meaningful interaction within the class.

To introduce data science, it makes sense that we ought to talk about data first. The word data is the plural of the the Latin word datum. One quick word before we continue: Because the word data is the plural of datum, I (and many people) prefer data as a plural noun—hence “What Are Data?” for the section title. (In fact, I think it’s funny to define data science as “the science of datums,” but that’s a terrible joke and I promise I won’t do it again in this book). However, it’s quite common in American English to treat data as a singular word—so common in fact, that you might notice me trip up and write “What is Data?” at some point. My opinion here is strong enough that I won’t mind if you point out when I’m inconsistent but not so strong that I’m going to get picky about how you treat the word—go with whatever comes more naturally to you. Even though we rarely use the singular datum, it’s worth briefly exploring its etymology. The word means “a given”—that is, something taken for granted. That’s important: The word data was introduced in the mid-seventeenth century to supplement existing terms such as evidence and fact. Identifying information as data, rather than as either of those other two terms, served a rhetorical purpose (Poovey, 1998; Posner &amp; Klein, 2017; Rosenberg, 2013). It converted otherwise debatable information into the solid basis for subsequent claims. Modern usage of the word data started in the 1940s and 1950s as practical electronic computers began to input, process, and output data. When computers work with data, all of that data has to be broken down to individual bits as the “atoms” that make up data. A bit is a binary unit of data, meaning that it is only capable of representing one of two values: 0 and 1. That doesn’t carry a lot of information by itself (at best, “yes” vs. “no” or TRUE vs. FALSE). However, by combining bits, we can increase the amount of information that we transmit. For example, even a combination of just two bits can express four different values: 00, 01, 10 and 11. Every time you add a new bit you double the number of possible messages you can send. So three bits would give eight options and four bits would give 16 options. When we get up to eight bits—which provides 256 different combinations—we finally have something of a reasonably useful size to work with. Eight bits is commonly referred to as a byte—this term probably started out as a play on words with the word bit (and four bits is sometimes referred to as a nibble or a nybble, because nerds like jokes). A byte offers enough different combinations to encode all of the letters of the (English) alphabet, including capital and small letters. There is an old rulebook called ASCII—the American Standard Code for Information Interchange—which matches up patterns of eight bits with the letters of the alphabet, punctuation, and a few other odds and ends. For example the bit pattern 0100 0001 represents the capital letter A and the next higher pattern 0100 0010 represents capital B. This is more background than anything else—most of the time (but not all of the time!) you don’t need to know the details of what’s going on here to carry out data science. However, it is important to have a foundational understanding that when we’re working with data in this class, the computer is ultimately dealing with everything as bits and translating combinations of bits into words, pictures, numbers, and other formats that makes sense for humans. This background is also helpful for pointing out that just like the word data has connotations related to trustworthiness, it also has connotations of things that are digital and quantitative. While all of these connotations are reasonable, it’s important that we understand their limits. For example, while many people think of data as numbers alone, data can also consist of words or stories, colors or sounds, or any type of information that is systematically collected, organized, and analyzed. Some folks might resist that broad definition of data because “words or stories” told by a person don’t feel as trustworthy or objective as numbers stored in a computer. However, one of the recurring themes of this course is to emphasize that data and data systems are not objective—even when they’re digital and quantitative. When I was introducing ASCII a few paragraphs ago, there were two details in there that might have passed you by but that actually have pretty important consequences. First, I noted that ASCII can “encode all the letters of the (English) alphabet”; second, I mentioned that the “A” in ASCII stood for “American.” Early computer systems in the United States were built around American English assumptions for what counts as a letter. This makes sense… but it has had consequences! While most modern computer systems have moved on to more advanced character encoding systems (ones that include Latin letters, Chinese characters, Arabic script, and emoji, for example), there are still some really important computer systems that use limited encoding schemes like ASCII. In 2015, Tovin Lapin wrote a newspaper article about this, noting that: Every year in California thousands of parents choose names such as José, André, and Sofía for their children, often honoring the memory of a deceased grandmother, aunt or sibling. On the state-issued birth certificates, though, those names will be spelled incorrectly. California, like several other states, prohibits the use of diacritical marks or accents on official documents. That means no tilde (~), no accent grave (`), no umlaut (¨) and certainly no cedilla (¸). Although more than a third of the state population is Hispanic, and accents are used in the names of state parks and landmarks, the state bars their use on birth records. There were attempts in 2014 to change this, but when lawmakers realized it would cost $10 million to update computer systems, things stalled. Moral of the story: even though ASCII is a straightforward technical system built on digital data with no real wiggle room for what means what, it’s still subjective and biased. How we organize data and data systems matters! So, even digital and quantitative data (systems) can be biased, which means that we ought to push lightly back against the rhetorical connotations of data as trustworthy. I’m not suggesting we throw data, science, and data science out the window and go with our gut and our opinions, but we shouldn’t take for granted that a given dataset doesn’t have its own subjectivity. Likewise, we ought to ask ourselves what information needs to become data before it can be trusted—or, more precisely, whose information needs to become data before it can be considered as fact and acted upon (Lanius, 2015; Porter, 1996). 5.1.2 What Is Data Science? If you think about it, data science is somewhat of an unintuitive name. As we noted earlier, data are more than numbers: they can be any type of information that is systematically collected, organized, and analyzed. Likewise, science simply implies a commitment to systematic methods of observation and experiment. Given these definitions, data science clearly means something more limited than science that uses data. History, for example, is a commitment to systematic methods of observation and relies on information that is systematically collected, organized, and analyzed, but we (generally) shouldn’t expect a historian to describe themselves (or be accepted) as a data scientist. Also relevant here is a critique by data and statistics expert Nate Silver, who once quipped that: I think data-scientist is a sexed up term for a statistician (Stats &amp; Data Science Views, 2013) There’s a certain amount of hype, prestige, and even sexiness associated with the term data science, and this ought to encourage us to be critical about how the term is used. Is data science just statistics gussied up to sound cooler? If all scientists use data, who is allowed to have access to the hype, prestige, and sexiness associated with data science? It is also important to acknowledge the elephant in the server room: the demographics of data science (and related occupations like software engineering and artificial intelligence research) do not represent the population as a whole. According to 2018 data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, released in 2018, only 26 percent of those in “computer and mathematical occupations” are women (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Across all of those women, only 12 percent are Black or Latinx women, even though Black and Latinx women make up 22.5 percent of the US population. (Women of Color in Computing Collaborative, 2018). A report by the research group AI Now about the diversity crisis in artificial intelligence notes that women comprise only 15 percent of AI research staff at Facebook and 10 percent at Google (Myers, Whittaker, &amp; Crawford, 2019). These numbers are probably not a surprise. The more surprising thing is that those numbers are getting worse, not better. According to a research report published by the American Association of University Women in 2015, women computer science graduates in the United States peaked in the mid-1980s at 37 percent, and we have seen a steady decline in the years since then to 26 percent today (Corbett &amp; Hill, 2015). As “data analysts” (low-status number crunchers) have become rebranded as “data scientists” (high status researchers), women are being pushed out in order to make room for more highly valued and more highly compensated men (Fouad, 2014). Disparities in the higher education pipeline aren’t only along gender lines. The same report noted specific underrepresentation for Native American women, multiracial women, White women, and all Black and Latinx people. So is it really a surprise that each day brings a new example of data science being used to disempower and oppress minoritized groups? In 2018, it was revealed that Amazon had been developing an algorithm to screen its first-round job applicants. But because the model had been trained on the resumes of prior applicants, who were predominantly male, it developed an even stronger preference for male applicants. It downgraded resumes with the word women and graduates of women’s colleges. Ultimately, Amazon had to cancel the project (Gershgorn, 2018; Kraus, 2018). This example reinforces the work of Safiya Umoja Noble (2018), whose book, Algorithms of Oppression, has shown how both gender and racial biases are encoded into some of the most pervasive data-driven systems—including Google search, which boasts over five billion unique web searches per day. Noble describes how, as recently as 2016, comparable searches for “three Black teenagers” and “three White teenagers” turned up wildly different representations of those teens. The former returned mugshots, while the latter returned wholesome stock photography. Unequal representation among data scientists is all the worse for the way it can lead to biases in data science projects. 5.1.3 What Does “Big Data” Mean? One possible distinction between data science and statistics is the amount of data we’re working with. Technology coverage in the 2010s (and continuing to the present) made it hard to resist the idea that big data represents some kind of revolution that has turned the whole world of information and technology topsy-turvy. But is this really true? Does big data change everything? Business analyst Doug Laney suggested that three characteristics make big data different from what came before: volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to the sheer amount of data. Velocity focuses on how quickly data arrives as well as how quickly those data become “stale.” Finally, variety reflects the fact that there may be many different kinds of data. Together, these three characteristics are often referred to as the “three Vs” model of big data. Note, however, that even before the dawn of the computer age we’ve had a variety of data, some of which arrives quite quickly, and that can add up to quite a lot of total storage over time. Think, for example, of the large variety and volume of data that has arrived annually at the Library of Congress since the 1800s! So, it is difficult to tell that big data is fundamentally a brand new thing. Furthermore, there are some concerns that we should exercise when it comes to big data. For example, when a data set gets to a certain size (into the range of thousands of rows), conventional tests of statistical significance are meaningless, because even the most tiny and trivial results are statistically significant. We’ll talk more about statistical significance later in the semester; for the time being, though, it suffices to say that statistical significance is how researchers have traditionally determined whether their results are important or not. If big data makes statistical significance more likely, then researchers who have access to more data will get more important results, whether or not that’s actually true in practical terms! Besides that, the quality and suitability of the data matters a lot: More data does not always mean better data. 5.2 The Many Skills of Data Science Data science owes a lot to statistics and mathematics, so you’d be forgiven for thinking of a data scientist as a statistician in a white lab coat staring fixedly at blinking computer screens filled with scrolling numbers. This isn’t quite the case, though: There is much to be accomplished in the world of data science for those of us who are more comfortable working with words, lists, photographs, sounds, and other kinds of information. In addition, data science is much more than simply analyzing data. There are many people who enjoy analyzing data and who could happily spend all day looking at histograms and averages, but for those who prefer other activities, data science offers a range of roles and requires a range of skills. Here are some skills that are particularly useful: Learning the application domain: A data scientist must quickly learn how the data will be used in a particular context. Communicating with data users: A data scientist must possess strong skills for learning the needs and preferences of users. Translating back and forth between the technical terms of computing and statistics and the vocabulary of the application domain is a critical skill. Seeing the big picture of a complex system: After developing an understanding of the application domain, a data scientist must imagine how data will move around among all of the relevant systems and people. Knowing how data can be organized: A data scientist must have a clear understanding about how data can be stored and linked, as well as about “metadata” (data that describes how other data are arranged). Data transformation and analysis: When data become available for the use of decision makers, a data scientist must know how to transform, summarize, and make inferences from the data. As noted above, being able to communicate the results of analyses to users is also a critical skill here. Visualization and presentation: Although numbers often have the edge in precision and detail, a good data display (e.g., a bar chart) can often be a more effective means of communicating re- sults to data users. Attention to quality: No matter how good a set of data may be, there is no such thing as perfect data. A data scientist must know the limitations of the data they work with, know how to quantify its accuracy, and be able to make suggestions for improving the quality of the data in the future. Ethical reasoning: If data are important enough to collect, they are often important enough to affect people’s lives. A data scientist must understand important ethical issues such as privacy and must be able to communicate the limitations of data to try to prevent misuse of data or analytical results. While a keen understanding of numbers and mathematics is important, particularly for data analysis, a data scientist also needs to have excellent communication skills, be a great systems thinker, have a good eye for visual displays, and be highly capable of thinking critically about how data will be used to make decisions and affect people’s lives. Of course there are very few people who are good at all of these things, so some of the people interested in data will specialize in one area, while others will become experts in another area. Of course, this also highlights the importance of teamwork. 5.3 Conclusion We can’t possibly cover all these skills in depth this semester, and even these skills are just the tip of the iceberg, which just emphasizes what a wide range is represented here. I hope their importance is clear, though—for example, which of these skills could have anticipated and responded to the problems involved with María showing up as Maria on a California birth certificate? 5.4 References Corbett, C., &amp; Hill, C.

Kim, and Arturo Valdivia licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Changes to the source material include light editing of original material, removing original material, changing citation style, adding new material, and replacing original authors’ “we” with an “I” for the current author. The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. Before we can start exploring data in R, there are some key concepts to understand first: What are R and RStudio? How do I code in R? What are R packages? If you are already somewhat familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to Section 6.4 where we’ll introduce our first dataset: all domestic flights departing one of the three main New York City (NYC) airports in 2023. We will explore this dataset in depth for much of the rest of this book. 6.1 What are R and RStudio? Throughout this book, I will expect that you are using R via RStudio. First time users often confuse the two. At its simplest, R is like a car’s engine while RStudio is like a car’s dashboard as illustrated in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.1: Analogy of difference between R and RStudio. More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations, whereas RStudio is (as we covered last week) an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rear-view mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by interacting with elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs (also called applications) you can open. We’ll always work in RStudio and not in the R application. Figure 6.2 shows what icon you should be clicking on your computer. Figure 6.2: Icons of R versus RStudio on your computer. After you open RStudio, you should see something similar to Figure 6.3. (Note that this interface changes over time and that it’s possible to customize it, so don’t be surprised if what you see on your—or a classmate’s—screen is slightly different.) Figure 6.3: RStudio interface to R. Note the three panes which are three panels dividing the screen: the console pane, the files pane, and the environment pane. Over the course of this chapter, you’ll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serves. 6.2 How do I code in R? Now that you’re set up with R and RStudio, you are probably asking yourself, “OK. Now how do I use R?”. The first thing to note is that unlike other statistical software programs like Excel, SPSS, or Minitab that provide point-and-click interfaces, R is an interpreted language. This means you have to type in commands written in R code. In other words, you have to code/program in R. Note that I’ll use the terms “coding” and “programming” interchangeably in this book. It is tempting to think that point-and-click software is superior to software that requires you to write your own code. We’re used to thinking of point-and-click software as newer and more modern than writing text commands! However, writing your own code typically gives you more control and power over what your software is doing; plus, by asking you to be more involved in the statistical analysis, it actually encourages you to learn more along the way. Speaking personally, I found that I learned a lot more about statistical analysis once I started using R than I had when I was using point-and-click interfaces. While it is not required to be a seasoned coder/computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that new R users need to understand. Consequently, while this book is not a book on programming, you will still learn just enough of these basic programming concepts needed to explore and analyze data effectively. 6.2.1 Basic programming concepts and terminology In my opinion and experience, completing actual projects in R does much more to help you learn the software than a written description. So, rather than ask you to memorize terms and concepts, I’ll ask you throughout the semester to complete walkthroughs (like this one) so that you’ll “learn by doing.” One important thing to help you with any of these walkthroughs is text formatting: I will always use a different font to distinguish regular text from computer_code. That said, it can be helpful to lay out some basic definitions and describe some basic concepts; don’t worry about committing all of this to memory, but you can come back here for clarification if you aren’t sure what a term means later on. Basics: Console pane: where you enter in commands. Running code: the act of telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the console. Objects: where values are saved in R. We’ll see how to assign values to objects and how to display the contents of objects. Data types: integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, and characters. Integers are values like -1, 0, 2, 4092. Doubles or numerics are a larger set of values containing both the integers but also fractions and decimal values like -24.932 and 0.8. Logicals are either TRUE or FALSE while characters are text such as “muesli,” “They Might Be Giants,” “Homestar Runner is a too-often-forgotten masterpiece of internet culture,” and “This chocolate mint tea is delicious.” Note that characters are often denoted with the quotation marks around them. Vectors: a series of values. These are created using the c() function, where c() stands for “combine” or “concatenate.” For example, c(6, 11, 13, 31, 90, 92) creates a six element series of positive integer values . Factors: categorical data are commonly represented in R as factors. Categorical data can also be represented as strings. We’ll study this difference as we progress through the book. Data frames: rectangular spreadsheets. They are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations. We’ll cover data frames later in Section 6.4. Conditionals: Testing for equality in R using == (and not =, which is typically used for assignment). For example, 2 + 1 == 3 compares 2 + 1 to 3 and is correct R code, while 2 + 1 = 3 will return an error. Boolean algebra: TRUE/FALSE statements and mathematical operators such as &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), and != (not equal to). For example, 4 + 2 &gt;= 3 will return TRUE, but 3 + 5 &lt;= 1 will return FALSE. Logical operators: &amp; representing “and” as well as | representing “or.” For example, (2 + 1 == 3) &amp; (2 + 1 == 4) returns FALSE since both clauses are not TRUE (only the first clause is TRUE). On the other hand, (2 + 1 == 3) | (2 + 1 == 4) returns TRUE since at least one of the two clauses is TRUE. Functions, also called commands: Functions perform tasks in R. They take in inputs called arguments and return outputs. You can either manually specify a function’s arguments or use the function’s default values. For example, the function seq() in R generates a sequence of numbers. If you just run seq() it will return the value 1. That doesn’t seem very useful! This is because the default arguments are set as seq(from = 1, to = 1). Thus, if you don’t pass in different values for from and to to change this behavior, R just assumes all you want is the number 1. You can change the argument values by updating the values after the = sign. If we try out seq(from = 2, to = 5) we get the result 2 3 4 5 that we might expect. We’ll work with functions a lot throughout this book and you’ll get lots of practice in understanding their behaviors. To further assist you in understanding when a function is mentioned in the book, I’ll also include the () after them as with seq() above. This list is by no means an exhaustive list of all the programming concepts and terminology needed to become a savvy R user; such a list would be so large it wouldn’t be very useful, especially for novices. However, this is a minimally viable list of programming concepts and terminology you need to know before getting started, and you can learn the rest as you go. Remember that your mastery of all of these concepts and terminology will build as you practice more and more. 6.2.2 Errors, warnings, and messages One thing that intimidates new R and RStudio users is how it reports errors, warnings, and messages. R reports errors, warnings, and messages in a glaring red font, which makes it seem like it is scolding you. However, seeing red text in the console is not always bad. MOre often than not, errors are our friends, in that they tlell us what we need to fix to get done what we want. R will show red text in the console pane in three different situations: Errors: when the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and will try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. For example, we’ll see in Subsection 6.3.3 if you see Error in ggplot(...) : could not find function \"ggplot\", it means that the ggplot() function is not accessible because the package that contains the function (ggplot2) was not loaded with library(ggplot2). Thus you cannot use the ggplot() function without the ggplot2 package being loaded first. Warnings: when the red text is a warning, it will be prefaced with “Warning:” and R will try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. For example, you will see in Chapter ?? if you create a scatterplot based on a dataset where two of the rows of data have missing entries that would be needed to create points in the scatterplot, you will see this warning: Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point). R will still produce the scatterplot with all the remaining non-missing values, but it is warning you that two of the points aren’t there. Messages: when the red text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning,” it’s just a friendly message. You’ll see these messages when you load R packages in the upcoming Subsection 6.3.2 or when you read data saved in spreadsheet files with the read_csv() function as you’ll see in Chapter ??. These are helpful diagnostic messages and they don’t stop your code from working. Additionally, you’ll see these messages when you install packages too using install.packages() as discussed in Subsection 6.3.1. Remember, when you see red text in the console, don’t panic. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Rather: If the text starts with “Error,” figure out what’s causing it. Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong! If the text starts with “Warning,” figure out if it’s something to worry about. For instance, if you get a warning about missing values in a scatterplot and you know there are missing values, you’re fine. If that’s surprising, look at your data and see what’s missing. Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working fine, but watch out/pay attention. Otherwise, the text is just a message. Read it, wave back at R, and thank it for talking to you. Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine and keep on going! 6.2.3 Tips on learning to code Learning to code/program is quite similar to learning a foreign language. It can be daunting and frustrating at first. Such frustrations are common and it is normal to feel discouraged as you learn. However, just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn and improve. Here are a few useful tips to keep in mind as you learn to program: Remember that computers are not actually that smart: You may think your computer or smartphone is “smart,” but really people spent a lot of time and energy designing them to appear “smart.” In reality, you have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore, the instructions you give your computer can’t have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way. Take the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach: Especially when you learn your first programming language or you need to understand particularly complicated code, it is often much easier to take existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends. This is as opposed to trying to type out the code from scratch. You can call this the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach. Early on, I suggest not trying to write code from memory but instead taking existing examples from the book and copying, pasting, and tweaking them to suit your goals. After you start feeling more confident, you can slowly move away from this approach and write code from scratch. Think of the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach as training wheels for a child learning to ride a bike. After getting comfortable, they won’t need them anymore. The best way to learn to code is by doing: Rather than learning to code for its own sake, I find that learning to code goes much smoother when you have a goal in mind or when you are working on a particular project, like analyzing data that you are interested in and that is important to you. Practice is key: Just as the only method to improve your foreign language skills is through lots of practice and speaking, the only method to improving your coding skills is through lots of practice. Don’t worry, however, we’ll give you plenty of opportunities to do so! 6.3 What are R packages? Another point of confusion with many new R users is the idea of an R package. R packages extend the functionality of R by providing additional functions, data, and documentation. They are written by a worldwide community of R users and can be downloaded for free from the internet. For example, among the many packages we will use in this book are the ggplot2 package [@R-ggplot2] for data visualization in Chapter ??, the dplyr package [@R-dplyr] for data wrangling in Chapter 18.2, the moderndive package [@R-moderndive] that accompanies this book, and the infer package [@R-infer] for “tidy” and transparent statistical inference in Chapters 36, ??, and ??. A good analogy for R packages is they are like apps you can download onto a mobile phone like in Figure 6.4: Figure 6.4: Analogy of R versus R packages. In thi s analogy, R is like a new smartphone: while it has a certain amount of features when you use it for the first time, it doesn’t have everything. R packages are like the apps you can download onto your phone from Apple’s App Store or Android’s Google Play. Let’s continue this analogy by considering the Instagram app for editing and sharing pictures. Say you have purchased a new phone and you would like to share a photo you have just taken with friends on Instagram. You need to: Install the app: Since your phone is new and does not include the Instagram app, you need to download the app from either the App Store or Google Play. You do this once and you’re set for the time being. You might need to do this again in the future when there is an update to the app. Open the app: After you’ve installed Instagram, you need to open it. Once Instagram is open on your phone, you can then proceed to share your photo with your friends and family. The process is very similar for using an R package. You need to: Install the package: This is like installing an app on your phone. Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. Thus if you want to use a package for the first time, you need to install it first. Once you’ve installed a package, you likely won’t install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version. “Load” the package: “Loading” a package is like opening an app on your phone. Packages are not “loaded” by default when you start RStudio on your computer; you need to “load” each package you want to use every time you start RStudio. Let’s perform these two steps for the ggplot2 package for data visualization. 6.3.1 Package installation There are two ways to install an R package: an easy way and a more advanced way. I am going to be rude and not teach you the easy way! My reason for this is that for our class projects, you have to load things the more advanced way, so you might as well get into the habit now. The recommended way to install a package is by typing install.packages(\"ggplot2\") in the console pane of RStudio and pressing Return/Enter on your keyboard. Note you must include the quotation marks around the name of the package. Let’s recap our analogy from earlier, because it’s important: Much like an app on your phone, you (typically) only have to install a package once. However, if you want to update a previously installed package to a newer version, you need to re-install it by repeating the earlier steps. Now, on your own, repeat the earlier installation steps, but for the dplyr, nycflights23, and knitr packages. This will install the earlier mentioned dplyr package for data wrangling, the nycflights23 package containing data on all domestic flights leaving a New York City airport in 2023, and the knitr package for generating easy-to-read tables in R. We’ll use these packages in the next section. Note that your output might be slightly different than the output displayed throughout the book, because packages get updated over time. This typically won’t be cause for concern, but if you’re worried about something, you can reach out to me and I can take a look. 6.3.2 Package loading Recall that after you’ve installed a package, you need to “load it” (just like you need to open an app on your smartphone, even after successfully installing it). We do this by using the library() command. For example, to load the ggplot2 package, run the following code in the console pane. What do we mean by “run the following code”? Either type or copy-and-paste the following code into the console pane and then hit the Enter key. library(ggplot2) If after running the earlier code, a blinking cursor returns next to the &gt; “prompt” sign, it means you were successful and the ggplot2 package is now loaded and ready to use. If, however, you get a red “error message” that reads ... Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ‘ggplot2’ ... it means that you didn’t successfully install it. This is an example of an “error message” we discussed in Subsection 6.2.2. If you get this error message, go back to Subsection 6.3.1 on R package installation and make sure to install the ggplot2 package before proceeding. Now, “load” the dplyr, nycflights23, and knitr packages as well by repeating the earlier steps. Note that you need quotation marks around package names for installing them—but not for loading them! 6.3.3 Package use One very common mistake new R users make when wanting to use particular packages is they forget to “load” them first by using the library() command we just saw. Remember: you have to load each package you want to use every time you start RStudio. Okay, technically speaking, this isn’t 100% true. RStudio will often save our workspace from last time we had the program open, including any packages that we had loaded. You may find that you have packages loaded even if you didn’t recently write and run the code to load them. However, you should get into the habit of loading packages every time you open RStudio and every time you work on something new. This will make sure that you never get an error! In particular, when you submit your R Markdown projects (not the week-to-week work, but the “big” class projects), the process of knitting the project for submission will not save your workspace from earlier, and if you don’t load your package in your project code, you will get an error. In a situation like this, if you don’t first “load” a package but attempt to use one of its features, you’ll see an error message similar to: Error: could not find function This is a different error message than the one you just saw on a package not having been installed yet. R is telling you that you are trying to use a function in a package that has not yet been “loaded.” R doesn’t know where to find the function you are using. Almost all new users forget to do this when starting out, and it is a little annoying to get used to doing it. However, you’ll remember with practice and after some time it will become second nature for you. 6.4 Explore your first datasets Let’s put everything we’ve learned so far into practice and start exploring some real data! Data comes to us in a variety of formats, from pictures to text to numbers. Throughout this book, we’ll focus on datasets that are saved in “spreadsheet”-type format. This is probably the most common way data are collected and saved in many fields. Remember from Subsection 6.2.1 that these “spreadsheet”-type datasets are called data frames in R. We’ll focus on working with data saved as data frames throughout this book. Let’s first load all the packages needed for this chapter, assuming you’ve already installed them. Read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages if you haven’t already. library(nycflights23) library(dplyr) library(knitr) At the beginning of all subsequent chapters in this book, we’ll always have a list of packages that you should have installed and loaded in order to work with that chapter’s R code. Again, RStudio may sneakily help you by keeping packages loaded in between sessions of working in R. Do not rely on RStudio to do this but instead get in the habit of loading packages every time you see one of these lists. 6.4.1 nycflights23 package Many of us have flown on airplanes or know someone who has. Air travel has become an ever-present aspect of many people’s lives. If you look at the Departures flight information board at an airport, you will frequently see that some flights are delayed for a variety of reasons. Are there ways that we can understand the reasons that cause flight delays? We’d all like to arrive at our destinations on time whenever possible. (Unless you secretly love hanging out at airports. If you are one of these people, pretend for a moment that you are very much anticipating being at your final destination.) Throughout this book, we’re going to analyze data related to all domestic flights departing from one of New York City’s three main airports in 2023: Newark Liberty International (EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), and LaGuardia Airport (LGA). We’ll access this data using the nycflights23 R package, which contains five datasets saved in five data frames: flights: Information on all flights. airlines: A table matching airline names and their two-letter International Air Transport Association (IATA) airline codes (also known as carrier codes) for 14 airline companies. For example, “DL” is the two-letter code for Delta. planes: Information about each of the 4,840 physical aircraft used. weather: Hourly meteorological data for each of the three NYC airports. This data frame has 26,207 rows, roughly corresponding to the \\(365 \\times 24 \\times 3 = 26,280\\) possible hourly measurements one can observe at three locations over the course of a year. airports: Names, codes, and locations of the 1,255 domestic destinations. The nycflights23 package is an updated version of the classic nycflights13 R package. nycflights23 was authored by Chester Ismay using the anyflights R package developed by Simon Couch. Simon granted permission to Ismay and his colleagues to create nycflights23 and submit the package to CRAN. 6.4.2 flights data frame We’ll begin by exploring the flights data frame and get an idea of its structure. Run the following code in your console, either by typing it or by cutting-and-pasting it. It displays the contents of the flights data frame in your console.

This particular data frame has 435,352 rows corresponding to different observations. Here, each observation is a flight. 22 columns corresponding to 22 variables describing each observation. year, month, day, dep_time, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, and arr_time are the different columns, in other words, the different variables of this dataset. We then have a preview of the first 10 rows of observations corresponding to the first 10 flights. R is only showing the first 10 rows, because if it showed all 435,352 rows, it would overwhelm your screen. ... with 435,342 more rows` and 14 more variables: indicating to us that 435,342 more rows of data and 11 more variables could not fit in this screen. Unfortunately, this output does not allow us to explore the data very well, but it does give a nice preview. Let’s look at some different ways to explore data frames. 6.4.3 Exploring data frames There are many ways to get a feel for the data contained in a data frame such as flights. We present three functions that take as their “argument” (their input) a data frame and a fourth method for exploring one column of a data frame: Using the View() function, which brings up RStudio’s built-in data viewer. Using the glimpse() function, which is included in the dplyr package. Using the kable() function, which is included in the knitr package. Using the $ “extraction operator,” which is used to view a single variable. 1. View(): Run View(flights) in your console in RStudio, either by typing it or cutting-and-pasting it into the console pane. Explore this data frame in the resulting pop up viewer. You should get into the habit of viewing any data frames you encounter. Note the uppercase V in View(). R is case-sensitive, so you’ll usually get an error message if you run view(flights) instead of View(flights). By running View(flights), we can explore the different variables listed in the columns. Observe that there are many different types of variables. Some of the variables like distance, day, and arr_delay are what we will call quantitative variables. These variables are numerical in nature. Other variables here are categorical. Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the View(flights) output, you’ll see a column of numbers. These are the row numbers of the dataset. If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row represents. This allows you to identify what object is being described in a given row by taking note of the values of the columns in that specific row. This is often called the observational unit. The observational unit in this example is an individual flight departing from New York City in 2023. You can identify the observational unit by determining what “thing” is being measured or described by each of the variables. We’ll talk more about observational units in Subsection 6.4.4 on identification and measurement variables. 2. glimpse(): The second way we’ll cover to explore a data frame is using the glimpse() function included in the dplyr package. Thus, you can only use the glimpse() function after you’ve loaded the dplyr package by running library(dplyr). This function provides us with an alternative perspective for exploring a data frame than the View() function: glimpse(flights) Rows: 435,352 Columns: 22 $ year &lt;int&gt; 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2… $ month &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… $ day &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… $ dep_time &lt;int&gt; 1, 18, 31, 33, 36, 503, 520, 524, 537, 547, 549, 551, 5… $ sched_dep_time &lt;int&gt; 2038, 2300, 2344, 2140, 2048, 500, 510, 530, 520, 545, … $ dep_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 203, 78, 47, 173, 228, 3, 10, -6, 17, 2, -10, -9, -7, -… $ arr_time &lt;int&gt; 328, 228, 500, 238, 223, 808, 948, 645, 926, 845, 905, … $ sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt; 3, 135, 426, 2352, 2252, 815, 949, 710, 818, 852, 901, … $ arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt; 205, 53, 34, 166, 211, -7, -1, -25, 68, -7, 4, -13, -14… $ carrier &lt;chr&gt; &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;DL&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;B6&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;UA&quot;, &quot;… $ flight &lt;int&gt; 628, 393, 371, 1053, 219, 499, 996, 981, 206, 225, 800,… $ tailnum &lt;chr&gt; &quot;N25201&quot;, &quot;N830DN&quot;, &quot;N807JB&quot;, &quot;N265JB&quot;, &quot;N17730&quot;, &quot;N925… $ origin &lt;chr&gt; &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;, &quot;JFK&quot;, &quot;EWR&quot;,… $ dest &lt;chr&gt; &quot;SMF&quot;, &quot;ATL&quot;, &quot;BQN&quot;, &quot;CHS&quot;, &quot;DTW&quot;, &quot;MIA&quot;, &quot;BQN&quot;, &quot;ORD&quot;,… $ air_time &lt;dbl&gt; 367, 108, 190, 108, 80, 154, 192, 119, 258, 157, 164, 1… $ distance &lt;dbl&gt; 2500, 760, 1576, 636, 488, 1085, 1576, 719, 1400, 1065,… $ hour &lt;dbl&gt; 20, 23, 23, 21, 20, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6,… $ minute &lt;dbl&gt; 38, 0, 44, 40, 48, 0, 10, 30, 20, 45, 59, 0, 59, 0, 0, … $ time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; 2023-01-01 20:00:00, 2023-01-01 23:00:00, 2023-01-01 2… $ gain &lt;dbl&gt; -2, 25, 13, 7, 17, 10, 11, 19, -51, 9, -14, 4, 7, 0, 4,… $ hours &lt;dbl&gt; 6.12, 1.80, 3.17, 1.80, 1.33, 2.57, 3.20, 1.98, 4.30, 2… $ gain_per_hour &lt;dbl&gt; -0.327, 13.889, 4.105, 3.889, 12.750, 3.896, 3.438, 9.5… Observe that glimpse() will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable name. In addition, the data type (see Subsection 6.2.1) of the variable is given immediately after each variable’s name inside &lt; &gt;. Here, int and dbl refer to “integer” and “double,” which are computer coding terminology for quantitative/numerical variables. “Doubles” take up twice the size to store on a computer compared to integers. In contrast, chr refers to “character,” which is computer terminology for text data. In most forms, text data, such as the carrier or origin of a flight, are categorical variables. The time_hour variable is another data type: dttm. These types of variables represent date and time combinations. However, we won’t work with dates and times in this book; we leave this topic for other data science books like Data Science: A First Introduction by Tiffany-Anne Timbers, Melissa Lee, and Trevor Campbell or R for Data Science [@rds2016]. 3. kable(): The final way to explore the entirety of a data frame is using the kable() function from the knitr package. Let’s explore the different carrier codes for all the airlines in our dataset two ways. Run both of these lines of code in the console: airlines kable(airlines) At first glance, it may not appear that there is much difference in the outputs. However, when using tools for producing reproducible reports such as R Markdown, the latter code produces output that is much more legible and reader-friendly. You’ll see me use this reader-friendly style in many places in the book when we want to print a data frame as a nice table. 4. $ operator Lastly, the $ operator allows us to extract and then explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console: airlines$name We used the $ operator to extract only the name variable and return it as a vector of length 16. We’ll only be occasionally exploring data frames using the $ operator, instead favoring the View() and glimpse() functions. 6.4.4 Identification and measurement variables There is a subtle difference between the kinds of variables that you will encounter in data frames. There are identification variables and measurement variables. For example, let’s explore the airports data frame by showing the output of glimpse(airports): glimpse(airports) Rows: 1,255 Columns: 8 $ faa &lt;chr&gt; &quot;AAF&quot;, &quot;AAP&quot;, &quot;ABE&quot;, &quot;ABI&quot;, &quot;ABL&quot;, &quot;ABQ&quot;, &quot;ABR&quot;, &quot;ABY&quot;, &quot;ACK&quot;, &quot;… $ name &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Apalachicola Regional Airport&quot;, &quot;Andrau Airpark&quot;, &quot;Lehigh Valle… $ lat &lt;dbl&gt; 29.7, 29.7, 40.7, 32.4, 67.1, 35.0, 45.4, 31.5, 41.3, 31.6, 41.0… $ lon &lt;dbl&gt; -85.0, -95.6, -75.4, -99.7, -157.9, -106.6, -98.4, -84.2, -70.1,… $ alt &lt;dbl&gt; 20, 79, 393, 1791, 334, 5355, 1302, 197, 47, 516, 221, 75, 18, 7… $ tz &lt;dbl&gt; -5, -6, -5, -6, -9, -7, -6, -5, -5, -6, -8, -5, -10, -6, -9, -6,… $ dst &lt;chr&gt; &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;A&quot;,… $ tzone &lt;chr&gt; &quot;America/New_York&quot;, &quot;America/Chicago&quot;, &quot;America/New_York&quot;, &quot;Amer… The variables faa and name are identification variables that uniquely identify each airport. faa provides the airport’s unique FAA code, while name gives its official name. These variables are used to uniquely identify each row in a data frame. The remaining variables (lat, lon, alt, tz, dst, tzone) are often called measurement or characteristic variables: variables that describe properties of each observational unit. For example, lat and long describe the latitude and longitude of each airport. Furthermore, sometimes a single variable might not be enough to uniquely identify each observational unit: combinations of variables might be needed. While it is not an absolute rule, for organizational purposes it is considered good practice to have your identification variables in the leftmost columns of your data frame. 6.4.5 Help files Another nice feature of R are help files, which provide documentation for various functions and datasets. You can bring up help files by adding a ? before the name of a function or data frame and then run this in the console. You will then be presented with a page showing the corresponding documentation if it exists. For example, let’s look at the help file for the flights data frame. ?flights The help file should pop up in the Help pane of RStudio. If you have questions about a function or data frame included in an R package, you should get in the habit of consulting the help file right away. 6.5 Conclusion This chapter provides a small set of tools to explore data in R, but it’s far from exhaustive. Including everything would overwhelm rather than help. The best way to add to your toolbox is running and writing code in RStudio as much as possible. 6.5.1 Additional resources If you are new to the world of coding, R, and RStudio and feel you could benefit from a more detailed introduction, we suggest the short book, Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown [@usedtor2016], previewed in Figure 6.5. It includes screencasts that you can follow along and pause as you learn. This book also contains an introduction to R Markdown, a tool used for reproducible research.

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 7.1 Introduction Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files—called a repository—in a sane, highly structured way. Think of it as the more powerful cousin of the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word. 7.2 Git—and GitHub—in Data Science Git has been re-purposed by the data science community to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports, and source code. A solo data scientist, working on a single computer, will benefit from adopting version control—but not nearly enough to justify the pain of installation and workflow upheaval. There are much easier ways to get versioned back ups of your files, if that’s all you’re worried about. This is where hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab come in. They provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet. Think of this as Dropbox or Google Drive for code. The service acts as a distribution channel or clearinghouse for your Git-managed project. It allows other people to see your stuff, sync up with you, and perhaps even make changes. These hosting providers improve upon traditional Unix Git servers with well-designed web-based interfaces. There are clear advantages to using one of these services: First, if someone needs to see your work or if you want them to try out your code, they can easily get it from GitHub. If they use Git, they can clone or fork your repository. If they don’t use Git, they can still browse your project on GitHub like a normal website and even grab everything by downloading a zip archive. Second, if you care deeply about someone else’s project, such as an R package you use heavily, you can track its development on GitHub. You can watch the repository to get notified of major activity. You can fork it to keep your own copy. You can modify your fork to add features or fix bugs and send them back to the owner as a proposed change. 7.3 GitHub in ICT/LIS 661 In this class, you will be accessing projects through GitHub. If you need feedback or help with your code, we’ll also use GitHub to send it back and forth. We won’t be using GitHub to its fullest extent, but this will at least give you some basic familiarity with the software. We are using GitHub—and not Bitbucket or GitLab—because GitHub is widely used in the R community, and because it’s what I’m most familiar with. However, it’s worth pointing out that the GitHub company has a history of controversy and that it has recently come under increased criticism from the same open source community that GitHub claims to serve. For the time being, I am continuing to use GitHub (personally and for this class), but I’m not thrilled about it. As we’ll discuss throughout the semester, it’s important to be attentive to ethics and values in data science, and I don’t think this is any exception. 7.4 Setting Up GitHub The remainder of this walkthrough is focused on helping you get GitHub set up for this class. 7.4.1 Creating a GitHub Account First things first, head on over to github.com and create an account. If you aren’t already using GitHub and are not sure you’ll be using GitHub in the future, I recommend creating an account with your @uky.edu address. However,you’re welcome to use a GitHub account you already have or to use a personal address if you think you’ll want to use this service more in the future. Here are some tips for picking a GitHub username: Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember. Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Bluesky or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that. Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss. Shorter is better than longer. Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames. Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence. Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. I highly recommend all lowercase. Usernames aren’t case sensitive in GitHub, but using all lowercase is kinder to people who may be working with GitHub data. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen (-) or underscore (_). 7.4.2 Setting up a GitHub Repository for Class In this next section, I’ve tried to be as specific as possible in providing instructions. However, past experience has shown me that what I see on my computer while walking through these steps isn’t always exactly what other people see due to operating system or other differences. If something doesn’t match perfectly what you see, use common sense to figure out the next best option. Once you’ve created a GitHub account, please navigate to this GitHub repository, which contains some crucial files for our class. If you have your browser window open wide enough, you should see a green Use this template button to the right of the menu above the list of files and directories (or folders). Click that button and, if prompted, click on Create a new repository. The next interface has a few different sections in it. You can ignore the first few options and then go down to where it says Owner: Make sure it lists your username there! If/as you continue to work with RStudio and GitHub, you’ll get a feel for what kind of directory names are most helpful to you, but I’m mandating a consistent format for selfish reasons: So that I can easily keep track of dozens of different repositories this semester. Give this project a name that follows this format: yourlastname_yourfirstname_661 That is, my project would be named Greenhalgh_Spencer_661. You can skip the Description line, but make sure to set your repository to Private. This is important so that your homework for this class isn’t publicly accessible! Once you’ve finished all the steps on this interface, GitHub will take you to the page for your repository. Find the Settings button near the top right of the page (if you can’t see it, you may need to make your browser window larger), and click on that. Once you’re in settings, navigate to Collaborators and then Add people. Then, enter my GitHub username, greenhas. Having access to your repository will make helping you with your code much easier in the future! 7.4.3 Installing GitHub Desktop Once you’ve done all this, navigate to desktop.github.com and download the GitHub Desktop client. Open it up and make sure to associate it with your GitHub account. There are plenty of other ways to use Git and GitHub, including the command line and RStudio itself, and if you’re serious about data science, I recommend learning more about both of those options (the Happy Git and GitHub for the useR website is helpful and thorough). You’re even free to try them this semester, but remember that my instructions are always going to assume you’re using this client. That’s because I find GitHub Desktop to be the most user-friendly approach to GitHub, and since our goals for this class are just a basic introduction to the service, it’s going to do the trick. Once you’ve signed in to GitHub Desktop, navigate to File and then Clone Repository. This will bring up a list of repositories that you have on GitHub for you to choose from; in this context, “clone” simply means to create a local copy of the repository on your computer. This next part is really important. Over the past few years, professors in technical fields have increasingly noticed that their students aren’t as familiar with computers’ file and folder systems as they are. When I was learning to use computers, it was critical that you know which files were in which folders in order to find them. In recent decades, the rise of cloud storage services (especially search-heavy ones like Google Drive), mobile operating systems, and other developments have made it so that your everyday computer user doesn’t have to (and, in the case of mobile devices, maybe can’t? at least not easily?) navigate through the different folders on their computer to save or retrieve files. However, if you’re working with programming tasks (like we are this semester), you do need to know where files are saved on your computer, what folders other folders are stored in, and that sort of thing. Not paying close attention to this is going to create at least mild inconveniences for you (and me) and, if you’re unlucky, more serious errors that will get in the way of your work. I do a lot of troubleshooting and office hours meetings in this class, and a significant portion of them are related to helping students with this. Now, I’m happy to provide troubleshooting and office hours meetings (it is, after all, my job, and it’s nice to have face-to-face conversations with online students), and I try not to bring this activity up in any “I told you so” kind of way, but you can save yourself (and me!) a lot of hassle over the next several weeks if you pay close attention to these details. If you genuinely don’t know what I’m talking about, ask me for help now and save yourself some trouble in the future! Right now, for example, you should pay attention to the Local Path option. By default, GitHub Desktop will create the local copy of your files within: a folder that has the same name as the repository, which is placed within: either a Documents folder or the main user folder of your computer You’re free to change this, but I strongly recommend sticking with the default folder name, and unless you have strong opinions about where to keep your files, it’s probably a good idea to stick with the default filepath, too. Wherever you end up storing your repository folder, pay close attention—you’ll be navigating back to it to complete your work throughout the semester. Please, please, please spend some time early on in this class to get to know Windows Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on macOS). Pay very close attention to where you’ve saved files, where those locations “live” on your computer, and that sort of thing. 7.5 Moving Forward As things currently stand, your repository isn’t really doing a whole lot, but that’s okay. We’ll return to GitHub next week as we learn some more about file and project management in RStudio, and practice good GitHub habits throughout the semester.

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 8.1 Introduction One goal of this reading is helping you understand the importance of reproducible analyses. The hope is to get you into the habit of making your data science analyses reproducible from the very beginning. Reproducibility means a lot of things in terms of different scientific fields, but they are all concerned with a common goal: Is research conducted in a way that another researcher could follow the steps and get similar results? The importance placed on reproducibility comes in part from a growing belief that a substantial portion of published research findings may actually report false positives—or, at the very least, overestimate the importance of a study’s findings (Simmons et al., 2011). Ioannidis (2005) went so far as to title an article “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False,” describing several problems in medical research that lead to false positive rates. If you can reproduce someone else’s research and get the same results, that suggests that the findings of the original study are on solid ground. However, if you try to follow their steps and get different results, there may be reason to question what the original researchers had to say. This is pretty straight forward, but reproducing someone else’s work isn’t as easy as it might seem. Most researchers in training eventually realize that short summaries of research methods in journal articles tidy over much of the complexity and messiness in research—especially research that involves humans. These summaries spare readers from trivial details, but they can also misrepresent important elements of the research process. However, if our goal is to provide practitioners, policymakers, and other researchers with data, theory, and explanations that lead to practical improvements, we need to provide them with a way to judge the quality and contextual relevance of research. That judgment depends in turn on how researchers choose to share the methods and processes behind their work. In data science, there is a particular emphasis on what is known as computational reproducibility. This refers to being able to pass all of one’s data analysis, datasets, and conclusions to someone else and have them get exactly the same results on their machine. This has obvious benefits for scientific concerns about reproducibility! In fact, one of my friends in graduate school had a job doing reproducibility for a political science journal. Anyone submitting research to be published in the journal also had to submit all of their data analysis, datasets, and conclusions. The paper to be published would be submitted to traditional peer review, but my friend would also review all of the submitted materials to make sure that there weren’t any discrepancies or errors in the data, analysis, and results described in the paper. There are also practical and personal benefits to computational reproducibility. In a traditional scientific workflow, you might do your statistical work and data visualization in RStudio and then write up your results in a word processor, pasting in helpful plots that you’d generated in RStudio. This isn’t a terrible demand on your time, but what if you discover a mistake partway through? Or what if someone gives you good advice on a late draft of your paper that leads you to make some changes to your data analysis? In a traditional workflow, you’d need to step through the entire process again: redo the analyses, redo the data visualization, rewrite the paper, repaste the plots. This is error prone and a frustrating use of time. In contrast, with the right software—and, more importantly, the right mindset—there are ways to include analysis and writing in the same document. Not only does this allow a colleague to easily reproduce all of the steps you’ve taken, but it might actually save you from having to redo work! This allows for data scientists to spend more time interpreting results and considering assumptions instead of spending time restarting an analysis from scratch or following a list of steps that may be different from machine to machine. Really committing to reproducibility means building new habits; it takes practice and will be difficult at times. Hopefully, though, you’ll see just why it is so important for you to keep track of your code and document it well to help yourself later and any potential collaborators as well. 8.2 Reproducibility and Paradigms I should make it clear from the beginning that I am an imperfect example of reproducibility. Part of this is because this is a difficult process—I’m still developing good habits and trying to get rid of bad habits. However, I also have philosophical differences with reproducibility as I’ve described it here. This isn’t to say that I disagree with the importance of reproducibility itself: I think it’s a fine idea, and I’m even going to enforce a certain level of it in this class! However, the reasons that reproducibility is important are often tied to basic assumptions that data scientists typically make about how the world works. While I draw heavily from data science techniques in my research, I also draw from research traditions that do not share the same assumptions as data science. 8.2.1 An Example Paradigm To explain more what I mean by this, let’s think about some of the assumptions that are implicitly present in my description of reproducibility in the previous section: Everyone ought to get the same results every time: As described above, reproducibility is related to a belief that different scientists should get similar results if individually performing the same analysis. If two scientists don’t come to the same answer when asking similar questions, that’s seen as a problem. People who work separately ought to come to the same conclusions. Research should be a series of nice, neat decisions: The basic idea of reproducibility is that it should be possible to provide a clear checklist that describes the steps that scientists took when carrying out an analysis. This only works if individual decisions can be clearly distinguished from each other and then communicated to another in a methodical way. Research is meant to inform practitioners and policymakers: Part of the reasoning behind making a research study reproducible is giving people confidence in the study’s findings; part of the reasoning behind giving people confidence in the study’s findings is so that other people can act on those findings. This perspective sees research as useful when it translates into specific actions that other stakeholders can take. Each of these three assumptions about research can be understood as connecting to a deeper assumption about how the world works and the resulting role of research: The world—including things and people in it—work in consistent, predictable ways; the point of research (including data science) is to figure out how the world works so that we can get the outcomes we want. In research settings, these collections of assumptions (and underlying worldview) are often referred to as a paradigm. These aren’t terrible assumptions, and this isn’t a bad paradigm! They’ve driven most of scientific progress and a lot of effective decision-making over the past couple of centuries. However, they’re not the only way of thinking about the world. Let me provide a recent example from my data science-adjacent research that rejects these assumptions in favor of a different set of assumptions. 8.2.2 Another Example Paradigm In mid-2019, I used R (and other software) to collect screenshots of about 1,400 tweets associated with a specific Twitter hashtag. The organizers of the hashtag claim that people who use the hashtag are simply members of a particular church and that their goal is to defend that church against its critics. However, outside observers have argued that participants in the hashtag are heavily influenced by toxic, far-right online communities and believe that these tweets are more motivated by white nationalism than religious beliefs. Over the course of several years, I worked with a colleague to carefully study each of these tweets so that we could come to some conclusions about what’s happening in this hashtag. Here are some of the assumptions that we had about our research: Different people might come to different conclusions: My co-researcher and I understood while studying these tweets that we might understand them differently. I grew up in the church that this hashtag is associated with, so I pick up on a lot of subtle references that my colleague doesn’t. However, as a woman, she picks up on subtle misogyny that sometimes sails right over my (masculine) head. We have different lived experiences, and we know that if we analyzed this data separately, we would probably come to different conclusions—that’s exactly why we’re working together. Research involves complex, messy decisions: What’s the point at which two researchers become confident that a 280-character post on Twitter includes a reference to white nationalism? The group that my colleague and I were studying was skilled at ambiguity and subtle references, so it’s not often the case that they clearly embrace extreme political views. It would be a mistake to ignore these views just because they’re not always easy to pin down, but it would also be irresponsible to exaggerate our conclusions. There’s no clear checklist for determining whether a tweet includes references to white nationalism—instead, we have to engage in lengthy discussions and make difficult calls. The goal of research is to develop understanding: I hope that our research makes some kind of difference in the world, and I know that my colleague does too. However, after reviewing our data and our conclusions, it’s not as if we have a list of specific actions that someone can take in response to our research. Who is that “someone” anyway? Twitter users? The church that this group claims to be loyal to? The group itself? Any of those populations could hypothetically learn something from what we have to say, but it would be a stretch to say that there’s a clear and immediate takeaway from our research. Our goal is to simply to document our findings in the hopes of increasing readers’ understanding of this kind of phenomenon. Each of our three assumptions about researchers can be understood as connecting to a paradigm we share: The world—including things and people in it—are rich, complex, and difficult to perfectly summarize; the point of research is to try to capture some of that richness so that we can better appreciate details and context. Some scientists are hostile to the idea of any paradigm except the first one and would be dismissive of the kind of research that I’ve just described. However, I’m confident that many data scientists acknowledge the existence and value of different research paradigms. Their response might be that the first paradigm works particularly well for data science, but that there’s no harm in using the second paradigm in other kinds of research. In fact, they might suggest that even if I did use R for that research project, it doesn’t really count as data science (to be honest, I’d agree with this evaluation, but remember what we’ve already read about what gets to count as data science!). 8.2.3 Why Do Paradigms Matter? In that case, what’s the point of making a big deal about paradigms here? If reproducibility is based on a paradigm about the predictability of the world, and if data science embraces that paradigm, why emphasize the existence of other paradigms? That’s a good question, but there’s an answer that’s just as good. In short, while it’s very useful to assume that the world is neatly ordered and predictable (remember all of those scientific and technological developments over the past couple of centuries?), it’s also possible to overemphasize that assumption—and overemphasis carries with it important ethical consequences. Let’s consider a concrete example related to data science. In recent years, there’s been considerable interest in sentencing algorithms. In other words, human judges are fallible and biased and might hand out different sentences for the same crime based not on an objective interpretation of the law but on their subjective responses to the accused. Wouldn’t it be great if we could come up with a computer program that would take in the facts of a case and information about the criminal and spit out an appropriate, fair sentence that a potentially biased judge couldn’t interfere with? The influence of the first paradigm ought to be clear here: Decisions ought to be consistent, so let’s boil down sentencing to a neat checklist-like algorithm that uses data to make a recommendation and make a practical difference. In theory, this sounds great—an application of data science that could make a real difference in the world. However, there are plenty of critics of this approach (including me). No one disputes that human judges are fallible and biased, and it would be fantastic to come up with a way of sentencing criminals that wouldn’t be as influenced by personal prejudices. The issue isn’t with the intent, it’s with the underlying paradigm. Critics of sentencing algorithms argue that in valuing consistency, predictable algorithms, and clear-cut recommendations, they overlook ways in which the world doesn’t actually work like that! For example, a sentencing algorithm would likely be trained on sentences given by human judges, and use those as the basis for the supposedly objective decision. However, as we’ve already established, human judges are fallible and biased; for example, we might (and almost certainly would!) find that judges give harsher sentences to criminals of color than white criminals. A sentencing algorithm that used race as a factor in determining sentences would therefore treat “non-white” as a statistically-valid reason to recommend a harsher sentence, simply because that’s the pattern that it was trained on. Rather than replace human bias, the algorithm would learn from it—but because humans tend to believe computers are more objective than humans, that bias would be harder to argue against! In a sense, this is a worse outcome, because it inherits bias but disguises it as an objective measure. This criticism implicitly adopts the second paradigm that I’ve described in this sentence: The process of sentencing a criminal is too rich and complex to distill down to a computational decision. More importantly, it points out a weakness of the first paradigm: A belief that the world is consistent and predictable is actually sometimes just a preference for things that seem consistent and predictable. That is, data scientists sometimes fall into the trap of believing that a consistent and predictable solution to a problem is better, when a solution that acknowledges complexity and nuance might feel less efficient but would do better at avoiding harm. 8.3 Supporting Reproducibility If I am sometimes resistant to calls for reproducibility, it is because I think the paradigm that these calls assume doesn’t always hold up. However, there’s nothing half-hearted about my teaching you about reproducibility in this class—it’s impossible to deny that there are amazing benefits to making your data science work reproducible (so long as data scientists critically examine their own paradigms). Let’s consider an example that I like a lot. Josh Rosenberg is one of my data science heroes. We went to grad school together, and 90% of what I know about R is thanks to him; if I have questions about R or data science, Josh is the first person I go to. When we were still in grad school, Josh participated in a study in which: independent analysts used the same dataset to test two hypotheses regarding the effects of scientists’ gender and professional status on verbosity during group meetings (Schweinsberg et al., 2021, p. 230) In other words, Josh and dozens of other researchers (the list of contributors to this study is literally a page long) were all given the same data and encouraged to test the same hypotheses. However, apart from the data and the hypotheses, the organizers of the study were intentionally skimpy on details. For example, it was up to individual researchers to determine how to best measure “professional status” using the available data, what statistical tests to use, etc. As a result, Researchers reported radically different analyses and dispersed empirical outcomes, in a number of cases obtaining significant effects in opposite directions for the same research question. (Schweinsberg et al., 2021, p. 230) In short, even though they were all given the same prompts and the same data, researchers made very different analytical decisions and came to very different results, sometimes producing conflicting (but individually compelling) findings. The article reports that Subjective researcher decisions play a critical role in driving the reported empirical results, underscoring the need for open data, systematic robustness checks, and transparency regarding both analytic paths taken and not taken. (Schweinsberg et al., 2021, p. 230) That is, scientists make lots of decisions when analyzing data. Even if they’re using the same data and asking the same questions, different, equally-qualified scientists might make wildly different decisions. In theory, any research article is supposed to contain a detailed section of how any analysis was completed, but as we’ve already read, word limits and researchers’ attention spans are too short for articles to cover every decision that could potentially make a difference. This is why reproducibility is important. If you can carefully document every decision you made, every line of code you wrote, and every other aspect of your analysis, other people will know not just what data you used and what questions you asked, but how—in very specific terms—you asked those questions. This is an undeniably good thing. So, how do we support reproducibility in practical terms? Here are a few—with a focus on how they play out in traditional academic research: 8.3.1 Open Design Research design is essential to any study as it dictates the scope and use of the study. This phase includes formulating the key research question(s), designing methods to address these questions, and making decisions about practical and technical aspects of the study. Typically, this entire phase is the private affair of the involved researchers. In many studies, the hypotheses are obscured or even unspecified until the authors are preparing an article for publication. Readers often cannot determine how hypotheses and other aspects of the research design have changed over the course of a study since usually only the final version of a study design is published. Moreover, there is compelling evidence that much of what does get published is misleading or incomplete in important ways. A meta-analysis (that is, research on other research) found that 33% of authors admitted to questionable research practices, such as “dropping data points based on a gut feeling,” “concealment of relevant findings,” and/or “withholding details of methodology” (Fanelli, 2009). Given that these numbers are based on self-reports and thus suspect to social desirability bias, it is plausible that these numbers are underestimates. For Open Design, researchers make every reasonable effort to give readers access to a truthful account of the design of a study and how that design changed over the duration of the study. Since study designs can be complex, this often means publishing different elements of a study design in different places. For instance, many academic journals publish short methodological summaries in the full text of an article and allow more detailed supplementary materials of unlimited length online. In addition, analytic code might be published in a linked GitHub account, and data might be published in an online repository. These various approaches allow for more detail about methods to be published, with convenient summaries for general readers and more complete specifics for specialists and those interested in replication and reproduction. There are also a variety of approaches for increasing transparency by publishing a time-stamped record of methodological decisions before publication: a strategy known as preregistration. Preregistration is the practice of documenting and sharing the hypotheses, methodology, analytic plans, and other relevant aspects of a study before it is conducted (Gehlbach &amp; Robinson, 2018; Nosek et al., 2015). 8.3.2 Open Analysis Open Analysis is the systematic reproduction of analytic methods conducted by other researchers—it’s the main support for reproducibility that has come up in this reading. Reproducing research is central to scientific progress because any individual study is generally insufficient to make robust or generalizable claims—the kinds that others could clearly act on. It is only after ideas are tested and replicated in various conditions and contexts and results “meta-analyzed” across studies that more durable scientific principles and precepts can be established. One form of replication is a reproduction study, where researchers attempt to faithfully reproduce the results of a study using the same data and analyses. Such studies are dependent on Open Design, so that replication researchers can use the same methodological techniques but also the same exclusion criteria, coding schemes, and other analytic steps that allow for faithful replication. In recent years, perhaps the most famous reproduction study was by Thomas Herndon, a graduate student at UMass Amherst who discovered that two Harvard economists, Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, had failed to include five columns in an averaging operation in an Excel spreadsheet (The Data Team, 2016). After averaging across the full data set, the claims in the study had a much weaker empirical basis. Ouch! In data science, where statistical code is central to conducting analyses, the sharing of that code is one way to make analytic methods more transparent. GitHub and similar repositories allow researchers to store code, track revisions, and share with others—GitHub’s importance for reproducibility is a major reason that we’re using it in this course. At a minimum, these repositories allow researchers to publicly post analytic code in a transferable, machine-readable platform. Used more fully, GitHub repositories can allow researchers to share preregistered codebases that present a proposed implementation of hypotheses, final code as used in publication, and all of the changes in between. Simply making code “available on request” will not be as powerful as creating additional mechanisms that encourage researchers to proactively share their analytic code: as a requirement for journal or conference submissions, as an option within study preregistrations, or in other venues. Reinhart and Rogoff’s politically consequential error might have been discovered much sooner if their analyses had been made available along with publication rather than after the idiosyncratic query of an individual researcher. 8.3.3 Open Publication Open Access (OA) literature is digital, online, available to read free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions (Suber, 2004). Most for-profit publishers obtain all the rights to a scholarly work and give back limited rights to the authors. With Open Access, the authors retain copyright for their article and the right to allow anyone to download and reprint provided that the authors and source are cited, for example under a Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0). Opening access increases the ability of researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to leverage scientific findings for the public good. Sharing a publicly accessible preprint can also be used to receive comments and feedback from fellow scientists, a form of informal peer review. Preprints are publicly shared manuscripts that have not (yet) been peer reviewed. A variety of peer-reviewed journals acknowledge the benefits of preprints. Across the physical and computer sciences, repositories such as ArXiv have dramatically changed publication practices and instituted a new form of public peer review across blogs and social media. In the social sciences, the Social Science Research Network and SocArXiv offer additional repositories for preprints and white papers. Preprints enable more iterative feedback from the scientific community and provide public venues for work that address timely issues or otherwise would not benefit from formal peer review. Whereas historically peer review has been considered a major advantage over these forms of nonreviewed publishing, the limited amount of available evidence suggests that the typically closed peer-review process has no to limited benefits (Bruce et al., 2016; Jefferson et al., 2002). Public scholarly scrutiny may prove to be an excellent complement, or perhaps even an alternative, to formal peer review. 8.4 Conclusion Data science is a field that values reproducibility, and we’re going to practice being reproducible as part of this course. It’s important to recognize that the value of reproducibility is based off of certain assumptions about what good research is and how the world works; those assumptions do not always hold up, and they can even be dangerous if we’re not careful about them. However, that doesn’t change the fact that there are real, powerful benefits to reproducibility. 8.5 References Bruce, R., Chauvin, A., Trinquart, L., Ravaud, P., &amp; Boutron, I. (2016).

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 9.1 Introduction A few years ago, I had to make an official correction to my most-cited research study. My co-author and I were revisiting some of the calculations in the study as part of a separate project, and we found some discrepancies between the published results and the results that my co-author was getting. It turned out that back in 2017, we hadn’t been working off of the same data file when working on separate parts of the paper, and that created small-but-embarrassing inconsistencies between what we had published and what the actual results were. When you’re doing data science work, it’s very important to keep things organized! We’ve run some code in R already, but how we manage that code can be really important. In this walkthrough, we’ll learn some more R and RStudio features before learning more about scripts and Projects in R. By way of reminder, whenever you see a “code chunk,” you should type (or copy) the code and run it on your own; however, remember also that output looks a lot like code chunks but doesn’t need to be run! A box that immediately follows a code chunk is probably just output: It’s there for you to compare your results against, not for you to copy and paste. Likewise, text that is marked as code but is in the middle of a paragraph doesn’t need to be run; it’s just a way of showing that something is code. 9.2 More About R and RStudio Begin this walkthrough by starting RStudio. By way of reminder, as you open up the program, you should see something similar to Figure 9.1. Figure 9.1: RStudio interface to R. Note again the three panes (that is, the three panels dividing the screen): the console pane, the files pane, and the environment pane. Let’s spend some more time in the Console, which is where we interact with the live R process. The following code tells R to assign the result of 3 * 4 (that is, 3 times 4) to an object called x and then asks R to “inspect” the object (that is, retrieve its contents). Go ahead and run it on your own: x &lt;- 3 * 4 x [1] 12 All R statements where you create object —“assignments”—have this form: objectName &lt;- value. It is technically possible to use = to make assignments, too, but it’s a pretty bad idea, for reasons we don’t need to go into here. Yes, it takes a bit more effort, but always make assignments with &lt;-. Object names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. It’s important to get into good habits with naming your objects. Many people use some kind of regular pattern in naming objects with multiple words: i_use_snake_case, other.people.use.periods, and evenOthersUseCamelCase. Make another assignment by running this code: this_is_a_really_long_name &lt;- 2.5 To inspect this object, try out RStudio’s completion facility: type the first few characters of this_is_a_really_long_name, press TAB, add characters until you disambiguate, then press return. Now, make another assignment: stromae_rocks &lt;- 2 ^ 3 What happens if we try to run the following code to inspect our new object? stromaerocks Error: object &#39;stromaerocks&#39; not found There’s an implicit contract when you work with a scripting language like R: The computer will do tedious computation for you, but you must be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. Details matter. I am always happy to help you troubleshoot, but please make sure that you’ve checked the details of your code first. It’s amazing how often errors come down to mistyping something. R has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are accessed like so: functionName(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, and so on). The details look different from function to function, but they typically follow this pattern. Let’s try functions using seq(), which makes regular sequences of numbers. While we’re at it, we’ll demo more helpful features of RStudio. Type se and hit TAB. A pop up shows you possible completions. Specify seq() by typing more to disambiguate or using the up/down arrows to select. Notice the floating tool-tip-type help that pops up, reminding you of a function’s arguments. If you want even more help, press F1 as directed to get the full documentation in the help tab of the lower right pane. You can also run a function with a ? in front of it (for example, ?seq()) to bring up the same help documentation. Now type the open parenthesis (() and notice the automatic addition of the closing parenthesis and the placement of cursor in the middle. Type the arguments 1, 10 and hit return. RStudio also exits the parenthetical expression for you. These little features are the things that can make RStudio really useful (though I’ll also admit that they sometimes get in the way, too). seq(1, 10) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Note that even though we ran this function, we didn’t assign the results to an object. That means that we can see the results in the Console, but we won’t be able to retrieve them later! If we want to hold onto the results of a function, we need to assign it to an object. Make this assignment and notice that RStudio helps with quotation marks in the same way that it helps with parentheses. yo &lt;- &quot;hello world&quot; If you just make an assignment, you don’t get to see the value, so then you’re tempted to immediately inspect. y &lt;- seq(1, 10) y [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 This common action can be shortened by surrounding the assignment with parentheses, which causes assignment and “print to screen” to happen. (y &lt;- seq(1, 10)) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Not all functions have (or require) arguments: date() [1] &quot;Mon Nov 17 10:47:19 2025&quot; Note that the output you get after running date() ought to be different than the output above… can you figure out why? Now look at your workspace in the upper right Environment pane. The workspace is where user-defined objects accumulate. You ought to see all of the objects that we’ve created so far in this walkthrough. You can also get a listing of these objects with these other commands: objects() ls() If you want to remove the object named y, you can do this: rm(y) To remove everything: rm(list = ls()) You can also click the broom in RStudio’s Environment pane to remove everything. Sometimes this is helpful when troubleshooting code. 9.3 The Console and the Workspace One day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis later. One day you will have multiple analyses going that use R and you want to keep them separate. One day you will need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results and figures from R back out into the world. To handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions: What from your analysis needs to be saved? Where does your analysis need to be saved? In the R code that we’ve written so far, we’ve run all of our code in the Console, and it’s been saved to the workspace. This has been sufficient for how we’ve done things so far, but it’s not a great long-term solution. Anything that we type into the Console gets saved into your “R history.” You can retrieve code from your R history by pressing the up arrow when your cursor is in the Console. This can be helpful for something you just typed, but it’s also a hassle to go all the way through your R history to find something that you typed hours (or even just minutes) ago. When you quit RStudio, it will generally prompt you to save your workspace; if you do, it will load it back automatically for you when you next open RStudio. This is also handy, but even though you have the results of your work, you don’t have easy access to the process that you took to get there. (That is, objects in your workspace are not easily reproducible). If you need to redo analysis, you’re going to either redo a lot of typing (making mistakes all the way) or will have to mine your R history (using those arrow keys in the console) for the commands you used. A better use of your time and psychic energy is to keep your “good” R code in a script for future reuse—and to keep your related scripts bundled together into a project. In other words, you can do one-off, temporary, or unimportant things in the Console, but most of your code is worth saving—especially if you need help troubleshooting it! 9.4 Holding Onto Code The rest of this walkthrough will demonstrate how to write code in a way that lets you hold onto it later. This can be really helpful for you (for example, when you want to adapt code from a class activity for one of your projects), and it’s also really helpful for me (for example, when I want to see all the code you ran when helping you troubleshoot an activity). 9.4.1 RStudio Projects Keeping all the files associated with a project organized together—input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures—is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this. These next few steps require the same careful attention to files and folders that setting up GitHub did last week. Please get into good habits now! Let’s make a project for you to use during the rest of this semester. In RStudio, navigate to File and then New Project. When prompted, click on Existing Directory and then navigate to the folder for the GitHub repository that you created last week. Then, quit RStudio, open up the file interface for your operating system, and make your way to that folder. You should now see a .Rproj file within that folder (with the same name as the folder). If you click on that .Rproj file, it will open up a project-specific window for RStudio, including an interface in the bottom-right corner that shows all the files and folders associated with your project. Since all of your work for this class will all be stored in this single project, it may not be clear during this semester just how useful this can be—trust me, it’s darn useful. Now that you’ve created this project file, you should always, always, ALWAYS open the project file instead of just RStudio. This is the only project file that you need to create for this class! However, following this advice means remembering where the project file is being stored. Remember my harping on last week about the importance of understanding where files and folders are stored on your computer? This is one of many examples of why that matters in this class. Before going any further in this walkthrough—or this class—take the time to make sure that you can navigate to your project file in either Windows Explorer (for Windows) or Finder (for macOS). Trust me, this is worth your time. The point of a project folder and project file is to have all of your files saved in the same place and to be able to open them up in a consistent interface every time. If you don’t know how to do this, you may end up with class files saved in three or four different places on your computer, and that will lead to wasted time and increased stress. So, again, take the time to figure this out now—and ask me for help if you need it. This will create lots of hassle for you in the future if you don’t pay attention now! As I mentioned before, once you know how to navigate to your project file, you should only ever open RStudio by double-clicking on that icon. Likewise, any and all of your work in class ought to be saved to the folder that your project file lives in. 9.4.2 Using Scripts The point of a project is to keep multiple files together. A file that is dedicated to code is what we call a script. Again, holding onto your code (instead of just running it through the console) will make your life easier and make it easier for me to help you when you need it. Think of a script in RStudio as being similar to a script in a play, with the console in RStudio similar to the stage on which a play takes place. Sure, the console (or the stage) is where the magic really happens, but the script is the authoritative record of what should be happening. Saving code to a script (like writing down a script for a play) lets us know what the expectations are, makes it easier to repeat a performance, and serves as a record for what happened (assuming that we followed the script). Unless I tell you otherwise, whenever you’re starting a new activity in R, you should navigate through File, New File, and New R Script in RStudio, give that file a clear name, and save that file to your project folder. If you save this file anywhere else, it’s going to make your life harder. Once again, make sure that you know where your project folder lives on your computer! It is traditional to save R scripts with a .R or .r suffix. Follow this convention unless you have some extraordinary reason not to. Use helpful names for your scripts so that you can find them afterward! Running code within a script file works differently than running it in the console, so you ought to get familiar with these extra steps: to execute code within a script, you should highlight the code you want to execute and either click the Run button at the top of script window or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or CMD+Enter (macOS). In theory, scripts are meant to be run all at once, and if you click the Run button without highlighting code, that’s what it will do. However, I (and many other R users) frequently use scripts in this kind of piecemeal way, running bits of code at a time, but keeping the whole script as a backup. 9.4.3 Backing Up Your Project Folder Make sure to save your scripts and other files regularly! Unlike cloud services like Dropbox or Google Drive, simply saving a file to your project folder is not sufficient to sync it to GitHub. At regular intervals, you should open GitHub Desktop, navigate to your project repository, and click the button in the top right corner (which will read either Fetch origin or Pull origin—if, after clicking Fetch origin, it now reads Pull origin, you’ll want to click it again). If I’ve made changes to your repository, those changes will now sync to your local files. Then, if there are changed files in the appropriate window of the interface, you should enter a Summary in the appropriate field, click the Commit button, and then click Push origin in the top-right corner. It’s not until you’ve successfully pushed your files to GitHub that they are backed up and available for me to request and review! It’s important to note Git and GitHub are notorious for running into syncing issues. We are using it lightly enough that I don’t expect to run into anything major, but please don’t hesitate to reach out if you run into something you can’t solve on your own! 9.5 Conclusion When helping you figure out an issue you’re having with code, I will usually insist on getting access to your data and scripts through your GitHub repository and will usually not look over scripts and data that you send me via email. This means that you need to be in the habit of: saving your code to scripts, saving your scripts to your project folder, and backing up your project folder through GitHub. Please get into this habit early—it will be helpful for you throughout the semester and even more helpful for any data science work you do after this class.

J. Allaire, and Garrett Grolemund, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 Changes to the source material include addition of new material; light editing; removing original material; and adding first-person language from current author. The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 10.1 Introduction Scripts are helpful for saving code for later, but to be truly reproducible, we often need to save more than just code. An R Markdown document can help us write a combination of text and code and then export it as a single document. This can be helpful for when you want to share your code, your results, and your thoughts on your results all together. This is helpful for this class in a number of ways! First, this entire textbook is written in R Markdown (well, kind of: “R Markdown” can a few different things, and this textbook doesn’t match all those definitions). Understanding chapters typically don’t have any code to go with them, but I can write text just fine. As we’ll see shortly, formatting the text requires me to use code rather than the kind of buttons that we’d use in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, but otherwise, it’s not that much different than writing in another kind of word processor. For walkthroughs, though, I not only need to write out instructions, but I also need to show you what code to run and what output you should expect to see. I tried doing that in another platform for the first edition of this textbook, and it was miserable; R Markdown is making me a much happier camper! Second, your class projects will all be submitted in R Markdown documents. It does mean asking you to learn a little bit about R Markdown, but it’s really useful for submitting and grading your assessments. Imagine that for each project, I asked you to submit your code, your data, and a separate Word file that contained your reflections. That would just be a hassle for both of us! With an R Markdown file, you can include your code, automatically show your results, and comment on what you found, all in a single document that you submit through Canvas. R Markdown builds on Markdown, a simple markup language (notice the pun?) that is popular in many ICT communities, including data science. A markup language is a way of using code to format text—HTML and XML are markup languages that you may be familiar with. Precisely speaking, R Markdown is based on Pandoc-flavored Markdown. There are many “flavors” of Markdown invented by different people, and Pandoc’s flavor is the best suited for data science work for a number of reasons. You can find the full documentation of Pandoc’s Markdown at https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html. If you really want to learn about R Markdown, you ought to consult that document; however, the truth is that we’re using it pretty lightly this semester, so this short walkthrough ought to do the trick. 10.2 Markdown syntax Syntax is a programming term that refers to what code needs to be used how in order to produce a desired result. Of course, syntax is also used to refer to human languages—this is one of the many ways that learning to program resembles learning a new language. R syntax and Markdown syntax are two different things, and an R script and an R Markdown (.Rmd) document work in two different ways. In an .Rmd document, RStudio will expect that you are writing normal text (not code) unless and until you specify that you want to write some code. In those normal text portions, it’s assumed that you’re writing with Markdown. The following sections go over some of the options that you have available when writing with Markdown. Pay close attention to syntax—we established earlier in this module that programming in R requires paying close attention to detail. There is often no room for typos or doing things “slightly differently.” That is also true of Markdown, but if you pay very close attention to the examples and advice below, things should go pretty smoothly. 10.2.1 Inline formatting Inline text will be italic if surrounded by underscores or asterisks, e.g., _text_ or *text*. Bold text is produced using a pair of double asterisks (**text**). A pair of tildes (~) turn text to a subscript (e.g., H~3~PO~4~ renders H3PO4). A pair of carets (^) produce a superscript (e.g., Cu^2+^ renders Cu2+). To mark text as inline code, use a pair of backticks, e.g., `code`. Hyperlinks are created using the syntax [text](link); for example, [here's a link to our Canvas](https://uk.instructure.com/courses/2156712/). The syntax for images is similar: just add an exclamation mark, e.g., ![alt text or image title](path/to/image). Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[], e.g., ^[This is a footnote.]. 10.2.2 Block-level elements Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs, e.g., # First-level header ## Second-level header ### Third-level header If you do not want a certain heading to be numbered, you can add {-} or {.unnumbered} after the heading, e.g., # Preface {-} Unordered list items start with *, -, or +, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list, e.g., - one item - one item - one item - one more item - one more item - one more item The output is: one item one item one item one more item one more item one more item Ordered list items start with numbers (you can also nest lists within lists), e.g., 1. the first item 2. the second item 3. the third item - one unordered item - one unordered item The output does not look too much different with the Markdown source: the first item the second item the third item one unordered item one unordered item Blockquotes are written after &gt;, e.g., &gt; &quot;I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet place and kill him.&quot; &gt; &gt; --- Mark Twain The actual output: “I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me, I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him to a quiet place and kill him.” — Mark Twain In general, you’d better leave at least one empty line between adjacent but different elements, e.g., a header and a paragraph. This is to avoid ambiguity to the Markdown renderer. For example, does “#” indicate a header below? In R, the character # indicates a comment. And does “-” mean a bullet point below? The result of 5 - 3 is 2. Different flavors of Markdown may produce different results if there are no blank lines. 10.2.3 R code chunks You can insert an R code chunk either using the RStudio toolbar (the Insert button) or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (Cmd + Option + I on macOS). That will create a little block in your document that begins with ```{r} and ends with ```. You can also manually type those characters onto two separate lines to create the code chunk. Once the code chunk is in place, you can type regular R code in there, run it, and see the output. There are a lot of things you can do in a code chunk, and you have fine control over all these output via chunk options. However, we don’t need to worry about those here—or even later on, since I have your code chunks set up for you in your project files. 10.3 Trying out R Markdown This walkthrough hasn’t been very interactive thus far! Let’s fix that by trying out some of the Markdown that we’ve been reading about. In RStudio, navigate to File, New File, and then R Markdown. On the next interface, just click on Create Empty Document in the bottom left corner. Once you have that file open, try writing a document that incorporates some of the formatting above. At regular intervals, click the Knit button to ask RStudio to transform your Markdown code into a formatted document. If something didn’t work as you expected, go back to the documentation above and pay close attention to details!

Changes to the source material include removal of original material, the addition of new material, combining of sources, and editing of original material for a different audience. The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0. 11.1 Introduction This reading’s focus on open data is closely related to a previous reading’s focus on reproducibility, which means that there’s value in revisiting the idea of paradigms. I’ll use some different examples and language here, but you ought to be able to see how what I’ve written here connects with our previous discussion. A great way to remember what paradigms are and how they differ is to compare molecular biology (my spouse’s major in college) and French (my major in college). A professor of molecular biology (or of any of the other “hard sciences”) assumes that there is a predictable reality behind what they’re studying. That is, organic molecules work in particular, quasi-universal ways, and if you can figure that out, you can introduce established causes to bring about desired effects. This is often called a positivist paradigm, with “positivist” having connotations of “rational” and “data-driven.” In contrast, a professor of French (or any of the other disciplines in the humanities) assumes that what they’re studying is important, but largely arbitrary. French is decidedly not universal—it’s something that humans made up instead of discovered. Plus, it doesn’t apply to most humans and isn’t consistent across the humans that it does apply to (for example, French-speaking people from Switzerland count differently than French-speaking people from Canada—they can’t even agree on numbers). Thus, while you could try to talk about French in terms of cause and effect, most French professors are more interested in understanding and describing French than in predicting it. This is often called an interpretivist paradigm, underlining its focus on trying to understand humans’ semi-arbitrary meaning-making. In between the hard sciences and the humanities, there’s a large, important mega-discipline we can call the social sciences, which includes library and information sciences, technology studies, education research, and many applications of data science. There’s a fair bit of dispute within the social sciences about whether they ought to be modeled after the hard sciences (with a positivist paradigm) or the humanities (with an interpretivist paradigm—or one of a few others we haven’t covered here). That is, when we’re studying people and people-related phenomena, can we assume that there are quasi-universal laws that govern and therefore predict human behavior in the same way we can of atoms, chemicals, and molecules? Or, is it safer to assume that people’s behavior is context-dependent rather than universal and something to be understood rather than predicted? Based on what I’ve already shared, it shouldn’t surprise you that I am more of an interpretivist than a positivist—my research is much more interested in describing and understanding phenomena because I’m skeptical about the possibility or value of predicting human behavior. That said, I have a healthy respect for positivism, and I’ll be the first to admit that trying to determine cause and effect is more directly “useful” than trying to document contextual variations in human behavior. I prefer the interpretivist paradigm, but the fact is that we need positivist views, too. 11.2 Positivism and the Need for Data Even the most committed positivist will acknowledge that even if there are universal laws governing the behavior of atoms, bacteria, humans, or organizations, it can be tremendously difficult to determine what those laws are, especially since a lot of the easy stuff was figured out centuries or decades ago by folks like Newton, Mendel, and Curie. To identify a cause and effect relationship with a great degree of confidence requires a few things, including access to appropriate data. Appropriate data can cost a lot of money to gather, be difficult to gather, take a lot of time to gather, or all of the above. As we’ve touched on previously, modern information and communication technologies make it a lot easier to collect data than ever before, but just because one researcher has collected data doesn’t necessarily mean that they will share it with others. Many researchers—understandably—take the stance that “if I put all the effort into gathering this data, I’m not going to give it to others to analyze for free.” Nonetheless, governments and research funding agencies are increasingly requiring the scientists they fund to share their data as a condition of that funding. In parallel, work is being done to think more comprehensively about how to collect, manage, and share data in appropriate, responsible ways. These open science efforts overlap considerably with the push for reproducibility that we’ve already discussed; if there is a difference, I would describe it as a difference between quality and quantity. Reproducibility largely argues that: testable science leads to better science, sharing scientific materials allows for testing science, and sharing scientific materials therefore makes for better science. Open science largely argues that more science leads to better science, sharing data allows for more science, and sharing data therefore makes for better science. In general terms, I think that both of these arguments are sound and that locking down scientific data is morally questionable—however, we’ll see later that there are privacy issues closely connected with data sharing. 11.3 Sharing Data In this chapter, I will use the term Open Data to the practice of proactively sharing the data associated with a study (often along with materials, analysis code, and other important elements of a study, in the spirit of reproducibility) on a public repository such as GitHub, the Open Science Framework, or others. Research data include all data that are collected or generated during scientific (or other) research. Although data science is chiefly concerned with quantitative data (that is, data in the form of numbers), many scientists will also share non-numeric qualitative data that they have collected, including texts, visual stimuli, interview transcripts, log data, diaries, and any other materials that were used or produced in a study. I mentioned above that there’s a great deal of overlap between open science efforts and reproducibility efforts, so there shouldn’t be any surprise that Open Data supports both! In line with the statement that scholarly work should be verifiable, Open Data is the philosophy that authors should, as much as is practical, make all the relevant data publicly available so they can be inspected, verified, reused, and further built on. That is, you might use someone else’s research data in order to check their work—or you might be researching something similar, so the fact that they’ve already collected relevant data is going to save you time and effort. There are strong scientific ideals underpinning both: The U.S. National Research Council (1997) stated that “Freedom of inquiry, the full and open availability of scientific data on an international basis, and the open publication of results are cornerstones of basic research” (p. 2). 11.4 Sharing Data and Privacy Sharing data is not a dichotomous issue: That is, it’s not a simple decision of “yes, I’m sharing my data” or “no, I’m not sharing my data.” Rather, researchers have to decide 1) what data to share 2) with whom and 3) when. Let’s look at some examples from the discipline of education, which is my professional background. In the U.S., the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) makes a wide variety of data sets publicly available for policymakers and researchers. This is good news! For several years, I’ve done research on how teachers use social media, and a few years ago, I put my head together with some other researchers to collectively ask whether teachers’ Twitter use in different U.S. states might have a connection with what education looks like in those states. We had the Twitter data, but it would have been really difficult for the three of us (especially with our barely existent budget) to come up with meaningful measures of what education policy looked like across different states. Luckily, there were gobs of data just waiting for us to download and consider on the NCES website! However, it’s not hard to imagine educational data that shouldn’t be available for any researcher who wants it. Examples related to the National Assessment of Education Progress (a regular assessment of what students in the United States know) demonstrate the need to balance privacy and openness. For example, school-level data (which contain no personally identifiable information) are made easily accessible through public data sets. In contrast, student-level data are maintained with far stricter guidelines for accessibility and use—as they should be. However, statistical summaries, documentation of data collection methods, and codebooks of data are made easily and widely available. 11.5 How to Share Data The most common approach to open data is simply making data “available on request.” A scientist mentions somewhere that they’ve collected some interesting data and asks people to get in touch with them if they want access to it. However, this approach simply doesn’t work. In one study, researchers requested data from 140 authors with articles published in journals that required authors to share data on request, but only 25.7% of these data sets were actually shared (Wicherts, Borsboom, Kats, &amp; Molenaar, 2006). What is even more worrying is that reluctance to share data is associated with weaker evidence and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results (Wicherts, Bakker, &amp; Molenaar, 2011). To increase the transparency of research, data should be shared proactively on a publicly accessible repository. GitHub can—and is—used for this, but other services are better equipped for it. Long-term and discoverable storage is advisable for data that are unique (i.e., can be produced just once) or that involved a considerable amount of resources to generate. These features are often true for qualitative and quantitative data alike. The value of shared data depends on quality of its documentation. Simply placing a data set online somewhere, without any explanation of its content, structure, and origin, is of limited value. A critical aspect of Open Data is ensuring that research data are findable (in a certified repository) as well as clearly documented by metadata and process documents (this is why GitHub, which doesn’t explicitly support this, isn’t as good for this sort of thing). In case research data cannot be shared at all, due to privacy issues or legal requirements, it is typically still possible to at least share metadata: information about the scope, structure, and content of the data set. For example, even though I’m generally excited about the idea of open science, I’m generally reluctant to share my Twitter data. For example, in the study I described above, we didn’t ask teachers for permission to collect their tweets before I studied them; that seems to me like a (perhaps justifiable) violation of privacy, so it’s important to me to protect these teachers’ privacy in other ways. So, I would never share the full set of data that I have, but when my co-authors and I did publish on this, we shared a summary of the data that leaves out any individual-level considerations. In addition, researchers can share “process documents,” which outline how, when, and where the data were collected and processed. In both cases (metadata and process documentation), transparency can be increased even when the research data themselves are not shared. New data-sharing repositories like Dataverse allow institutions or individual researchers to create data projects and share different elements of that project under different requirements so that some elements are accessible publicly and others require data use agreements (King, 2007). 11.6 Benefits of Sharing Data Open Data can improve the scientific process both during and after publication, in keeping with the connections to reproducibility and open science that we’ve made earlier. Without access to the data underlying a paper that is to be reviewed, peer reviewers are substantially hindered in their ability to assess the evidential value of the claims. Allowing reviewers to audit statistical calculations will have a positive effect on reducing the number of calculation errors, unsupported claims, and erroneous descriptive statistics that are later found in the published literature (Nuijten, Hartgerink, van Assen, Epskamp, &amp; Wicherts, 2016; Van der Zee, Anaya, &amp; Brown, 2017). Open Data also enables secondhand analyses and increases the value of gathering data, which require direct access to the data and cannot be performed using only the summary statistics typically presented in a paper. Data collection can be a lengthy and costly process, which makes it economically wasteful to not share this valuable commodity. Open Data is a research accelerator that can speed up the process of establishing new important findings (Pisani et al., 2016; Woelfle, Olliaro, &amp; Todd, 2011). 11.7 Downsides of Sharing Data Perhaps the strongest objection to Open Data sharing concerns issues of privacy protection. Safeguarding the identity and other valuable information of research participants is of utmost importance and takes priority over data sharing, but these are not mutually exclusive endeavors. Sharing data is not a binary decision, and there is a growing body of research around differential privacy that suggests a variegated approach to data sharing (Daries et al., 2014; Gaboardi et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2014). Even when a data set cannot be shared publicly in its entirety, it may be possible to share de-identified data or, as a minimum, information about the shape and structure of the data (i.e., metadata). Daries et al. (2014) provided one case study of a de-identified data set from MOOC learners, which was too “blurred” for accurately estimating distributions or correlations about the population but could provide useful insights about the structure of the data set and opportunities for hypothesis generation. However, it should also be noted that it is sometimes easier to “re-identify” data than people think—especially in the world of big data: According to a paper … in Scientific Reports … researchers at MIT and the Université Catholique de Louvain, in Belgium, analyzed data on 1.5 million cellphone users in a small European country over a span of 15 months and found that just four points of reference, with fairly low spatial and temporal resolution, was enough to uniquely identify 95 percent of them. In other words, to extract the complete location information for a single person from an “anonymized” data set of more than a million people, all you would need to do is place him or her within a couple of hundred yards of a cellphone transmitter, sometime over the course of an hour, four times in one year. A few Twitter posts would probably provide all the information you needed, if they contained specific information about the person’s whereabouts. (Hardesty, 2013) For textual data, such as transcripts from interviews and other forms of qualitative research, there are tools that allow researchers to quickly de-identify large bodies of texts, but textual data can also be deeply personal, so I’d personally have misgivings about sharing that data with others. Even when a whole data set cannot be shared, subsets might be shareable to provide more insight into coding techniques or other analytic approaches. Privacy concerns should absolutely shape decisions about what researchers choose to share, and researchers should pay particular attention to implications for informed consent and data collection practices, but research into differential privacy shows that openness and privacy can be balanced in thoughtful ways. Another concern with data sharing is “scooping” and problems with how research production is incentivized. Researchers are often under a lot of pressure to produce a lot of research, and research is nearly always judged on whether it contributes something new to human understanding. So, sharing your own data could potentially allow someone else to do an analysis that you were hoping to publish, and I don’t blame people for worrying about that. Furthermore, data scientists often work in the corporate world, and companies are probably even more protective of their data, since they don’t want competitors to see it. However, it’s also possible to go too far with this concern. For example, in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, Longo and Drazen (2016) stated that: “There is concern among some front-line researchers that the system will be taken over by what some researchers have characterized as ‘research parasites’” (para. 3). Specifically, these authors were concerned that scholars might “parasitically” use data gathered by others; they suggested that data should instead be shared “symbiotically,” for example by demanding that the original researchers will be given co-author status on all papers that use data gathered by them. This editorial, and especially the framing of scholars as “parasites” for reusing valuable data, sparked considerable discussion. In fact, this discussion resulted in the “Research Parasite Award,” which reclaimed the derisive reference in the service of genuinely celebrating rigorous secondary analysis. 11.8 Incentives for Sharing Data These concerns—and their connection to how scientific research works—demonstrates the need to provide incentives for sharing data. The U.S. National Research Council (1997) has argued: “The value of data lies in their use. Full and open access to scientific data should be adopted as the international norm for the exchange of scientific data derived from publicly funded research” (p. 10). There are various ways to make better use of the data that we have already generated, such as data sets with persistent identifiers, so they can be properly cited by whoever has reused the data. This way, the data collectors continue to benefit from sharing their data as they will be repeatedly cited and have proof of how their data have been fundamental to others’ research. There is evidence that Open Data increase citation rates (Piwowar, Day, &amp; Fridsma, 2007), and other institutional actors could play a role in elevating the status of Open Data. An increasing number of academic journals have started to award special badges that will be shown on a paper that is accompanied by publicly available data in an Open Access repository. Journal policies can also have a strong positive effect on the prevalence of Open Data (Nuijten et al., 2017). Scholarly societies and research foundations could create new awards for the contribution of valuable data sets in education research. Perhaps most importantly, promotion and tenure committees in universities should recognize the value of contributing data sets to the public good and ensure that young scholars can be recognized for those contributions. 11.9 Conclusion Open data is an important component of the data science community, and it’s also important for supporting reproducibility and advancing science. Like other components of reproducibility, the value of open data emerges from a particular set of assumptions about how science works, and other scientific perspectives can help raise concerns about privacy and other issues. Nonetheless, so long as it is done responsibly, sharing data is a good and important thing. 11.10 References Daries, J. P., Reich, J., Waldo, J., Young, E. M., Whittinghill, J., Ho, A. D., . . .

Understanding and application of data science are both great, but neither is very useful if you can’t bring them into a specific situation and make them work for you. With that in mind, most future connection activities (and all of your projects) are going to expect that you have access to a data set that you feel a personal or professional connection to. Ideally, you’d find a data set that is connected to your (present, past, or hoped-for future) professional context, whether that’s retrieved from your workplace (with permission, of course) or at least contextually relevant. However, I’ve also enjoyed seeing 661 students work with personally meaningful datasets related to Pokémon, Spotify, sports, or other interests. While I’m going to encourage you to pick something professionally relevant, the most important thing is that you work with something interesting. This activity is all about finding one such relevant data set. If you find a solid data set today (one that meets the explicit and implicit requirements of projects and activities), you may be able to stick with it throughout the rest of the semester. However, if you get bored with a data set—or realize that your go-to data set won’t work for a particular activity—you can always find something else. 12.2 Signs of a Good Dataset Before we get into the details, here are some important characteristics you’ll want to look for in data sets: at least 100 observations (rows) and 5 variables (columns) depending on the activity, you’ll probably want at least 5 quantitative variables (i.e., numbers); other variables are great, but they aren’t compatible with a lot of the statistical techniques we’ll be talking about although we challenge this idea in our class, more data is often better from a statistical point of view; if you can find a dataset with at least 1,000 observations and 10 variables, that will probably make things easier for you stored in a spreadsheet file format personally, I prefer .csv; I find it easier to work with, and it’s standard in data science circles .xsl and .xslx Excel spreadsheets are also common and supported by data import functions; however, I’ll be focusing on .csv when providing assistance, so you will either have to do some extra research to adapt my code, or you’ll want to convert your spreadsheet to .csv “tidy” data if you can find datasets that advertise themselves as tidy (1 observation per row, 1 variable per column), that will probably save you some hassle that said, we won’t cover tidy data until later in the semester, and it’s not always easy to tell whether another party’s dataset is tidy, so don’t stress too much about this 12.3 Finding a Good Dataset Okay, now for the finding! There are plenty of sources for interesting data on the internet. The Kaggle collection of datasets is full of freely-available data ranging from the serious to the silly. It’s a great place to look if you don’t know where else to go. Governments of all kinds and sizes also collect data: You might search for federal, state, or local collections of “open data” if you think there might be something interesting for you there. A workplace is a good place to check for data so long as you can be sure that you have permission to do so. Finally, there are a lot of datasets associated with R packages. You can do some searching for one of those right now or pay close attention to the ones that we meet over the next few weeks; you might find one that you want to return to! Once you’ve found the dataset you want to work with (at least for now), give it a short-but-descriptive name. If it’s a file format other than a .csv, you should either convert it into a .csv or be ready to look up how to load a file in another format into R, since I won’t be providing those directions. Once the file is ready to be used, move it to the activity_data folder inside the project folder that you previously created for this class. Then, open up GitHub Desktop to commit this change to your project and push the changes so that they sync with the GitHub website. I mentioned above that you’re free to stick with this data throughout the rest of the semester or that you can switch to new datasets whenever you feel like it. If you ever switch to a new dataset, make sure that you follow the steps above (giving it a short-but-descriptive name, ensuring it’s a .csv or that you know how to load other data types, placing it in your activity_data folder, and committing and pushing your changes in GitHub Desktop) every time. 12.4 Loading Your Dataset I’ve already emphasized in a couple of walkthroughs up to this point that it’s important to be attentive to details when working in R. This is especially true when it comes to loading data into R. Up to this point, we have only worked with data that is preloaded in R packages; so long as you’ve properly loaded the package in question, you’ve loaded the data as well. A lot of our walkthroughs will only ever ask you to work with this data. However, later in the course, you’ll be adapting code from the walkthroughs to work with your own data; more importantly, you’ll be working with your own data when completing course projects. When you’re working with your own data, you need to make sure it gets loaded into RStudio before your code can work with it. Let’s practice doing that now. We’re going to learn to do this through code. There is also a way to do this through the RStudio interface instead of typing out the code, but I’m not going to cover it here. My reasons for doing so are multiple. To begin with, I always load my data through code, so I honestly don’t know how to do it the other way off the top of my head. Of course, I could look it up, but I also have other strong reasons for not covering this. Loading your data through the interface may be more straightforward when you’re completing walkthroughs and one-off activities, but: it is not reproducible, and it makes it harder for me to troubleshoot your code if you need any help, and it does not play nice with the .Rmd documents that you will use to submit your class projects, so you will have to load through code for the projects To practice loading data, start by creating a new script in RStudio. Last week, we emphasized that saving your code in scripts is really helpful for referencing it later. You might want to give this script a name like data_loading.R or something like that, to make it easy to reference in the future in case you need a refresher on how to load your own data. Please note that with future activities, I’m going to assume that you’re creating a new script for each activity and that you’re giving it a descriptive name—you won’t get advice like this in all walkthroughs! However, we’re still in the early stages of working with R, so a reminder here might be helpful! We’re going to use two packages as part of our loading process: tidyverse and here. Chances are that you don’t have these packages installed yet, so you can do that now by running install.packages(\"tidyverse\") and install.packages(\"here\"). I recommend running this code in the Console. I’ve put a lot of emphasis on saving code in a script, but there’s always code that is so unimportant that it doesn’t need to be saved. This includes installing packages, which is almost always a one-and-done thing that doesn’t need to be repeated (at least, not for a while). Besides, if you include installation code in the .Rmd files for your class projects, it creates all sorts of problems. Now, let’s go ahead and load those packages: library(tidyverse) library(here) We’re going to cover the tidyverse package in more detail in a couple of weeks, so for now, just trust me that it’s important and necessary. The here package, on the other hand, is worth getting into now. For any program on a computer to work with a file, it has to know where that file is so that it can access it. Modern programs on modern computers make this process so easy for us that we often don’t have to pay attention to the details of where a file is. R, on the other hand, is not so generous; it usually needs specific instructions for where to find a file before it can load it. The point of the here package is to make giving those specific instructions a bit easier for us. Let’s see what I mean by running the function here() now that we have the package of the same name loaded: here() [1] &quot;/Users/spencergreenhalgh/spg_website/static/ICT_LIS_661_textbook_2025_Fall&quot; This is another case where the output that you see in the book is different than the output you’ll see where you run this code—and that’s the point of here()! What this function does is to figure out the filepath for the folder that contains the R project you’re working in. So, the output that I get when I run here() is the location of the R project associated with this textbook; it’s also formatted the way that macOS (the operating system I’m currently using) formats locations. You ought to get output that tells you the location of the R project that you set up for this class and that formats it in the way that your operating system formats locations. Think of here() as a shortcut that takes you to the main folder that you’re working in; that way, you only have to provide the extra detail beyond that. (At the risk of repeating myself, though, this emphasizes the importance of finding and working in the expected main folder. If you’re not doing that, here() won’t be as helpful.) For example, if you’ve followed the directions in the previous section, you should have your dataset for this activity saved in the activity_data folder. I also have a dataset—called Twitter_hashtags.csv—saved in my activity_data folder. If I run the following code, it tells R that I I’m looking inside my project folder (what the here() function figures out on its own) to find a subfolder called activity_data inside that project folder, to find a file called Twitter_hashtags.csv inside that subfolder. The result is the exact location of the file on my computer, providing a lot more information that I didn’t have to type out on my own! here(&quot;activity_data&quot;,&quot;Twitter_hashtags.csv&quot;) [1] &quot;/Users/spencergreenhalgh/spg_website/static/ICT_LIS_661_textbook_2025_Fall/activity_data/Twitter_hashtags.csv&quot; When you run this code, it’s unlikely that your dataset is named Twitter_hashtags.csv, so you should replace that with the name of your file. Likewise, as we saw above, your output should also look different because the location of your project folder is different than the location of mine! No matter how different your output looks, though, you ought to notice how much shorter your here() argument is than the exact location that you might otherwise have to type out. That’s why here() is useful! In fact, let’s get to the good stuff. Now that I have the exact location of my dataset on my computer, I can put that inside the read_csv() function, which (as the name suggests), loads .csv files into RStudio. With the following code, I’m going to read my data in and save it as an object called df (short for dataframe—it’s a lazy-but-handy default name for the object containing your data). df &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;activity_data&quot;,&quot;Twitter_hashtags.csv&quot;)) Rows: 60 Columns: 22 ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; chr (1): hashtags dbl (21): avg_hashtags_per_tweet, avg_mentions_per_tweet, proportion_origina... ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. You should run this code yourself. You can give your object a more descriptive name than df if you want, but you absolutely have to change Twitter_hashtags.csv to the name of your file if you want this to work! Once again, you should expect your output to look different than mine; my output is a quick summary of my data; your output will be a quick summary of your data. The explanation-to-code ratio of this walkthrough is pretty high—higher than is ideal. The important part is that you remember this last line of code that you ran; so long as you save your data to the activity_data subfolder in your project folder and replace Twitter_hashtags.csv with the name of your dataset, this code will be a reliable way for you to load data into R. Knowing how to do this will be very useful for you for class projects and other activities. The rest of the explanation is just to emphasize how important this line of code is!

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY 4.0. 13.1 Introduction Earlier this semester, each of you set up an account with GitHub. As of June 2018, this online code-management platform had over twenty-eight million users worldwide. By allowing users to create web-based repositories of source code (among other forms of content) to which project teams of any size can then contribute, GitHub makes collaborating on a single piece of software or a website or even a book much easier than it has ever been before (this book is hosted in GitHub, as is a book on data science in education written by my friend Josh and his co-authors). Unfortunately, though, there’s a gender dynamic present to this “much easier.” A 2016 study found that female GitHub users were less likely to have their contributions accepted if they identified themselves in their user profiles as women. The authors do not appear to have considered nonbinary genders, although they do maintain a category for “gender-neutral” usernames that cannot be categorized as either men’s or women’s names (Terrell et al,. 2017). Critics of GitHub’s commitment to inclusivity, or the lack thereof, also point to the company’s internal politics. In 2014, GitHub’s cofounder was forced to resign after allegations of sexual harassment were brought to light (Miller, 2014). More recently, in 2018, Agnes Pak, a former top attorney at GitHub, sued the company for allegedly altering her performance reviews after she complained about her gender and race contributing to a lower compensation package, giving them the grounds to fire her (Baron, 2018). Pak’s suit came shortly after transgender software developer Coraline Ada Ehmke declined a significant severance package in 2017 so that she could talk publicly about her negative experience of working at GitHub (Ehmke, 2017). Clearly, GitHub has several major issues of corporate culture that it must address. But a corporate culture that is hostile to women does not necessarily preclude other feminist interventions, and GitHub makes one important one: Its platform helps show the work of writing collaborative code. In addition to basic project management tools, like bug tracking and feature requests, the GitHub platform also generates visualizations of each team member’s contributions to a project’s codebase. Area charts, arranged in small multiples, allow viewers to compare the quantity, frequency, and duration of any particular member’s contributions. A line graph reveals patterns in the day of the week when those contributions took place. And a flowchart-like diagram of the relationships between various branches of the project’s code helps to acknowledge any sources for the project that might otherwise go uncredited, as well as any additional projects that might build upon the project’s initial work. Coding is work, as anyone who’s ever programmed anything knows well. But it’s not always work that is easy to see. The same is true for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data. We tend to marvel at the scale and complexity of an interactive visualization like the Ship Map, which plots the paths of the global merchant fleet over the course of the 2012 calendar year. By showing every single sea voyage, the Ship Map exposes the networks of waterways that constitute our global product supply chain. However, we are less often exposed to the networks of processes and people that help constitute the visualization itself—from the seventy-five corporate researchers at Clarksons Research UK who assembled and validated the underlying dataset, to the academic research team at University College London institute that developed the data model, to the design team at Kiln that transformed the data model into the visualization that we see. And that is to say nothing of the tens of thousands of commercial ships that served as the source of data in the first place. Visualizations like the Ship Map involve the work of many hands. Unfortunately, however, when releasing a data product to the public, we tend not to credit the many hands who perform this work. We often cite the source of the dataset, and the names of the people who designed and implemented the code and graphic elements. But we rarely dig deeper to discover who created the data in first place, who collected the data and processed them for use, and who else might have labored to make creations like the Ship Map possible. Admittedly, this information is sometimes hard to find. Likewise, when project teams (or individuals) are already operating at full capacity, or under budgetary strain, this information can—ironically—simply be too much additional work to pursue (see Martin, 2010). Even in cases in which there are both resources and desire, information about the range of the contributors to any particular project sometimes can’t be found at all. 13.2 Invisible Labor But the various difficulties we encounter when trying to acknowledge this work reflects a larger problem in what information studies scholar Miriam Posner (2018) calls our data supply chain. Like the contents of the ships visualized on the Ship Map, about which we only know sparse details—the map can tell us if a shipping container was loaded onto the boat, but not what the shipping container contains—the invisible labor involved in data work, as Posner argues, is something that corporations have an interest in keeping out of public view. To put it more simply, it’s not a coincidence that much of the work that goes into designing a data product—visualization, algorithm, model, app—remains invisible and uncredited. In our capitalist society, we tend to value work that we can see. This is the result of a system in which the cultural worth of any particular form of work is directly connected to the price we pay for it; because a service costs money, we recognize its larger value. More often than not, though, the reverse also holds true: We fail to recognize the larger value of the services we get for free. When, in the early 1970s, the International Feminist Collective launched the Wages for Housework campaign, it was this phenomenon of invisible labor—labor that was unpaid and therefore unvalued—that the group was trying to expose (see Federici, 1975). The precise term they used to describe this work was reproductive labor, which comes from the classical economic distinction between the paid and therefore economically productive labor of the marketplace, and the unpaid and therefore economically unproductive labor of everything else. By reframing this latter category of work as reproductive labor, rather than simply (and inaccurately) unproductive labor, groups like the International Feminist Collective sought to emphasize how the range of tasks that the term encompassed, like cooking and cleaning and child-rearing, were precisely the tasks that enabled those who performed “productive” labor, like office or factory work, to continue to do so. The Wages for Housework movement began in Italy and migrated to the United States with the help of labor organizer and theorist Silvia Federici. It eventually claimed chapters in several American cities, and did important consciousness-raising work. Still, as prominent feminists like Angela Davis pointed out, while housework might have been unpaid for White women, women of color—especially Black women in the United States—had long been paid, albeit not well, for their housework in other people’s homes: “Because of the added intrusion of racism, vast numbers of Black women have had to do their own housekeeping and other women’s home chores as well” (Davis, 1983). Here, Davis is making an important point about racialized labor: just as housework is structured along the lines of gender, it is also structured along the lines of race and class. The domestic labor of women of color was and remains underwaged labor, as feminist labor theorists would call it, and its low cost was what permitted (and continues to permit) many White middle- and upper-class women to participate in the more lucrative waged labor market instead. Since the 1970s, the term invisible labor has come to encompass the various forms of labor, unwaged, underwaged, and even waged, that are rendered invisible because they take place inside of the home, because they take place out of sight, or because they lack physical form altogether. Visit this Internet Archive capture of the now-defunct WagesforFacebook.com and you’ll find a version of the Wages for Housework argument updated for a new form of invisible work. This invisible labor can be found all over the web, as digital labor theorists such as Tiziana Terranova (2000) have helped us to understand. “They call it sharing. We call it stealing,” is one of the statements that scrolls down the screen in large black type. The word it refers to work that most of us perform every day, in the form of our Facebook likes, Instagram posts, and Twitter tweets. The point made by Laurel Ptak, the artist behind Wages for Facebook—a point also made by Terranova—is that the invisible unpaid labor of our likes and tweets is precisely what enables the Facebooks and Twitters of the world to profit and thrive. 13.3 The Invisible Labor of Data Science The world of data science is able to profit and thrive because of unpaid invisible labor as well. Perhaps my “favorite” example of this is from the very geeky xkcd webcomic, which once ran the following comic: Self Driving by Randall Munroe is licensed under CC BY-NC 2.5 Have you ever wondered why these distinctive CAPTCHA tests require you to do image identification? Or why they’re so often related to roads, signs, and vehicles? The idea behind a CAPTCHA test is to require a human to do a task that an automated system can’t do. That’s a pretty good way of telling a human from an automated system! Ironically, though, those aggregated human tasks are often used to train automated systems to work better. Google (who owns the popular reCAPTCHA system) uses CAPTCHA tests to train systems for automated image recognition—which has obvious benefits if you’re developing self-driving cars. Ever since reading this comic, I’ve gotten angry whenever I complete one of these. Not only does such-and-such a website believe that I’m a robot, but the only way to prove my humanity is to do free work for Google. All I get out of it is to continue to the website I want, but Google is in a position to make gobs of money based on my (and millions of others’) free labor. Other crowdsourcing projects (helping Netflix with its recommendation algorithm, helping a newspaper go through interesting documents, etc.) are framed as acts of benevolence (and, in the case of Netflix, an opportunity to win a million-dollar prize). People should want to contribute to these projects, their proponents claimed, since their labor would further the public good. It’s also worth pointing out, though, that when he coined the term in the mid-2000s, Jeff Howe argued that crowdsourcing was a powerful way to tap networked knowledge for corporate use. “The labor isn’t always free, but it costs a lot less than paying traditional employees,” he wrote (Howe, 2006). Plus, Ashe Dryden, the software developer and diversity consultant, points out that people can only help crowdsource if they have the inclination and the time (Dryden, 2014). Think back to that study of GitHub. If you were a woman and you knew your contributions to a programming project were less likely to be accepted than if you were a man, would that motivate you to contribute the project? Or, for another example, consider Wikipedia. Although the exact gender demographics of Wikipedia contributors are unknown, numerous surveys have indicated that those who contribute content to the crowdsourced encyclopedia are between 84 percent and 91.5 percent men (Hills &amp; Shaw, 2013; Wikimedia, n.d.). Why? It could be that there, too, edits are less likely to be accepted if they come from women editors (Whose Knowledge, n.d.). It could also be attributed to Wikipedia’s exclusionary editing culture and technological infrastructure, as science and technology studies (STS) scholars Heather Ford and Judy Wajcman (2017) have argued. And there is also reason to go back to the housework argument. Dryden cites a 2011 study showing that women in twenty-nine countries spend more than twice as much time on household tasks than men do, even when controlling for women who hold full-time jobs (Miranda, 2011). Like the other estimates of gender cited here, the study did not consider nonbinary genders or same-sex (or other non-heterotypical) households. But even as a rough estimate, it seems that women simply don’t have as much time. 13.4 Time and Money In capitalist societies, it’s very often the case that time is money. But it’s also important to remember to ask whose time is being spent and whose money is being saved. The premise behind Amazon’s Mechanical Turk—or MTurk, as the crowdsourcing platform is more commonly known—is that data scientists want to save their own time and their own bottom line. The MTurk website touts its access to a global marketplace of “on-demand Workers,” who are advertised as being more “scalable and cost-effective” than the “time consuming [and] expensive” process of hiring actual employees (Amazon Mechanical Turk, n.d.) Thus, MTurk is a marketplace for crowdsourced human labor—individuals and businesses that have “human intelligence tasks” can set up jobs for online workers to complete. Often repetitive, like describing images or taking surveys, the jobs are compensated in tiny financial increments that don’t add up to a minimum hourly wage—not to mention a living wage. However, a recent study by the Pew Research Center showed that 51 percent of US-based Turkers, as they are known, hold college degrees, and 88 percent are below the age of fifty, among other metrics that would otherwise rank them among the most desired demographic for salaried employees (Hitlin, 2016). This form of underwaged work is also increasingly outsourced from the United States to countries with fewer (or worse) labor laws and fewer (or worse) opportunities for economic advancement. A 2010 University of California, Irvine study measured a 20 percent drop in the number of US-based Turkers over the eighteen months that it monitored (Ross et al., 2010). This trend has continued, the real-time MTurk tracker shows. (The gender split, interestingly, has evened out over time.) Even at resource-rich companies like Amazon and Google, the work of data entry is profoundly undervalued in proportion to the knowledge it helps to create. Andrew Norman Wilson’s 2011 documentary Workers Leaving the Googleplex exposes how the workers tasked with scanning the books for the Google Books database are hired as a separate but unequal class of employee, with ID cards that restrict their access to most of the Google campus and that prevent them from enjoying the company’s famed employee perks. 13.5 Crediting Data Work The emphasis on giving formal credit for a broad range of work derives from feminist practices of citation. Feminist theorist Sara Ahmed describes this practice as a way of resisting how certain types of people—usually cis and White and male—“take up spaces by screening out others” (Ahmed, 2013). When those other people are screened out, they become invisible, and their contributions go unrecognized. The screening techniques (as Ahmed terms them) that lead to their erasure are not always intentional, but they are, unfortunately, self-perpetuating. Ahmed gives the example of sinking into a leather armchair that is comfortable because it’s molded to the shape of your body over time. You probably wouldn’t notice how the chair would be uncomfortable for those who haven’t spent time sitting in it—those with different bodies or with different demands on their time. Which is why those of us who occupy those comfortable leather seats—or, more likely in the design world, molded plastic Eames chairs—must remain vigilant in reminding ourselves of the additional forms of labor, and the additional people, that our own data work rests upon. This gets complicated quickly even on the scale of a single data science project. The names of all the people and the work they perform are not always easy to locate—if they can be located at all. But taking steps to document all the people who work on a particular project at the time that it is taking place can help to ensure that a record of that work remains after the project has been completed. In fact, this is among the four core principles that comprise the Collaborators’ Bill of Rights, a document developed by an interdisciplinary team of librarians, staff technologists, scholars, and postdoctoral fellows in 2011 in response to the proliferation of types of positions, at widely divergent ranks, that were being asked to contribute to data-based (and other digital) projects (“Collaborators’ Bill of Rights”, 2011; see also Di Pressi et al., 2018). When designing data products from a feminist perspective, we must similarly aspire to show the work involved in the entire lifecycle of the project. This remains true even as it can be difficult to name each individual involved or when the work may be collective in nature and not able to be attributed to a single source. In these cases, we might take inspiration from the Next System Project, a research group aimed at documenting and visualizing alternative economic systems (Gibson-Graham &amp; the Community Economies Collective, 2017). In one report, the group compiled information on the diversity of community economies operating in locations as far-ranging as Negros Island, in the Philippines; Québec province, in Canada; and the state of Kerala, in India. The report employs the visual metaphor of an iceberg, in which wage labor is positioned at the tip of the iceberg, floating above the water, while dozens of other forms of labor—informal lending, consumer cooperatives, and work within families, among others—are positioned below the water, providing essential economic ballast but remaining out of sight. But in more instances than you might think, the labor associated with data work can be surfaced through the data themselves. For instance, historian Benjamin Schmidt (2017), whose research centers on the role of government agencies in shaping public knowledge, decided to visualize the metadata associated with the digital catalog of the US Library of Congress, the largest library in the world. Schmidt’s initial goal was to understand the collection and the classification system that structured the catalog. But in the process of visualizing the catalog records, he discovered something else: a record of the labor of the cataloguers themselves. When he plotted the year that each book’s record was created against the year that the book was published (you can see the plot here), he saw some unusual patterns in the image: shaded vertical lines, step-like structures, and dark vertical bands that didn’t match up with what one might otherwise assume would be a basic two-step process of (1) acquire a book and (2) enter it in. The shaded vertical lines, Schmidt soon realized, showed the point at which the cataloguers began to turn back to the books that had been published before the library went digital, filling in the online catalogue with older books. The step-like patterns indicated the periods of time, later in the process, when the cataloguers returned to specific subcollections of the library, entering in the data for the entire set of books in a short period of time. And the horizontal lines? Well, given that they appear only in the years 1800 and 1900, Schmidt inferred that they indicated missing publication information, as best practices for library cataloguing dictate that the first year of the century be entered when the exact publication date is unknown. With an emphasis on showing the work, these visual artifacts should also prompt us to consider just how much physical work was involved in converting the library’s paper records to digital form. The darker areas of the chart don’t just indicate a larger number of books entered into the catalog, after all. They also indicate the people who typed them all in. (Schmidt estimates the total number of records at ten million and growing.) Similarly, the step-like formations don’t just indicate a higher volume of data entry. They indicate strategic decisions made by library staff to return to specific parts of the collection and reflect those staff members’ prior knowledge of the gaps that needed to be filled—in other words, their intellectual labor as well. Schmidt’s visualization helps to show how the dataset always points back to the data setting—to use Yanni Loukissas’s helpful phrase—as well as to the people who labored in that setting to produce the data that we see. 13.6 Crediting Emotional Labor and Care Work In addition to the invisible labor of data work, there is also labor that remains hidden because we are not trained to think of it as labor at all. This is what is known as emotional labor, and it’s another form of work that feminist theory has helped to bring to light. As described by feminist sociologist Arlie Hochschild (2012), emotional labor describes the work involved in managing one’s feelings, or someone else’s, in response to the demands of society or a particular job. Hochschild coined the term in the late 1970s to describe the labor required of service industry workers, such as flight attendants, who are required to manage their own fear while also calming passengers during adverse flight conditions, and generally work to ensure that flight passengers feel cared for and content. In the decades that followed, the notion of emotional labor was supplemented by a related concept, affective labor, so that the work of projecting a feeling (the definition of emotion) could be distinguished from the work of experiencing the feeling itself (the definition of affect). We can see both emotional and affective labor at work all across the technology industry today. Consider, for instance, how call center workers and other technical support specialists must exert a combination of affective and emotional labor, as well as technical expertise, to absorb the rage of irate customers (affective labor), reflect back their sympathy (emotional labor), and then help them with—for instance—the configuration of their wireless router (technical expertise; see Brophy &amp; Woodcock, 2019). In the workplace, we might also consider the affective labor required by women and minoritized groups, in all situations, who must take steps to disprove (or simply ignore) the sexist, racist, or otherist assumptions they face—about their technical ability or about anything else. And they must do so while also performing the emotional labor that ensures that they do not threaten those who hold those assumptions, who often also hold positions of power over them. Are there ways to visualize these forms of labor, giving visual presence—and therefore acknowledgement and credit—to these outlays of work? 13.7 Show Your Work Data work is part of a larger ecology of knowledge, one that must be both sustainable and socially just. Like the ship paths visualized on the Ship Map or the source code stored on GitHub, the network of people who contribute to data projects is vast and complex. Showing this work is an essential component of feminist data science. An emphasis on labor opens the door to the interdisciplinary area of data production studies: taking a data visualization, model, or product and tracing it back to its material conditions and contexts, as well as to the quality and character of the work and the people required to make it. This kind of careful excavation can be undertaken in academic, journalistic, or general contexts, in all cases helping to make more clearly visible—and therefore to value—the work that data science rests upon. We can also look to the data themselves in order to honor the range of forms of invisible labor involved in data science. Who is credited on each project? Whose work has been “screened out”? While one strategy is to show the work behind making data products themselves, another strategy for honoring work of all forms is to use data science to show the work of people (mostly women) who labor in other sectors of the economy, those that involve emotional labor, domestic work, and care work. Designing in solidarity with domestic workers can begin to challenge the structural inequalities that relegate their work to the margins in the first place. This point brings us back to ideas about power that we will read about throughout this semester. Power imbalances are everywhere in data science: in our datasets, in our data products, and in the environments that enable our data work. Showing the work is crucial to ensure that undervalued and invisible labor receives the credit it deserves, as well as to understand the true cost and planetary consequences of data work. 13.8 References Ahmed, S.

Boko Haram, a militant terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attacks. The press coverage, both in Nigeria and around the world, was fast and furious. SaharaReporters.com challenged the government’s ability to keep its students safe. CNN covered parents’ anguish. The Japan Times connected the kidnappings to the increasing unrest in Nigeria’s northern states. And the BBC told the story of a girl who had managed to evade the kidnappers. Several weeks after this initial reporting, the popular blog FiveThirtyEight published its own data-driven story about the event, titled “Kidnapping of Girls in Nigeria Is Part of a Worsening Problem” (Chalabi, 2014). The story reported skyrocketing rates of kidnappings. It asserted that in 2013 alone there had been more than 3,608 kidnappings of young women. Charts and maps accompanied the story to visually make the case that abduction was at an all-time high—here’s a link to one prominent one. Shortly thereafter, the news website had to issue an apologetic retraction because its numbers were just plain wrong. The outlet had used the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT) as its data source. GDELT is a big data project led by computational social scientist Kalev Leetaru. It collects news reports about events around the world and parses the news reports for actors, events, and geography with the aim of providing a comprehensive set of data for researchers, governments, and civil society. GDELT tries to focus on conflict—for example, whether conflict is likely between two countries or whether unrest is sparking a civil war—by analyzing media reports. However, as political scientist Erin Simpson pointed out to FiveThirtyEight in a widely cited Twitter thread (archived here), GDELT’s primary data source is media reports. The project is not at a stage at which its data can be used to make reliable claims about independent cases of kidnapping. The kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria was a single event. There were thousands of global media stories about it. Although GDELT de-duplicated some of those stories to a single event, it still logged, erroneously, that hundreds of kidnapping events had happened that day. The FiveThirtyEight report had counted each of those GDELT pseudoevents as a separate kidnapping incident. The error was embarrassing for FiveThirtyEight, not to mention for the reporter, but it also helps to illustrate some of the larger problems related to data found “in the wild.” First, the hype around “big data” leads to projects like GDELT wildly overstating the completeness and accuracy of its data and algorithms. On the website and in publications, the project leads have stated that GDELT is “an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world, connecting every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what’s happening around the world, what its context is and who’s involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day” (Leetaru, n.d.). 14.2 Bigger is not Always Better This boasting by GDELT is typical of projects that ignore context, fetishize size, and inflate their technical and scientific capabilities. In doing so, they tap into patriarchial, cis-masculinist, totalizing fantasies of world domination as enacted through data capture and analysis. In fact, D’Ignazio and Klein (the original authors of this material) make a pointed comparison between masculinity and data science in terms of obsession with… size… that I have edited out here. You can read their comparison at the link in the attributions above—or review Gieseking (2018), which uses similar wordplay to make an important critique of big data. In GDELT’s case, the question is whether we should take its claims of big data at face value or whether the emphasis on size is trying to trick funding organizations into giving the project massive amounts of research funding. (This trick has worked many times before.) The GDELT technical documentation does not provide any more clarity as to whether it is counting media reports (as Simpson asserts) or single events. The database FiveThirtyEight used is called the GDELT Event Database, which certainly makes it sound like it’s counting events. The GDELT documentation states that “if an event has been seen before it will not be included again,” which also makes it sound like it’s counting events. And a 2013 research paper related to the project confirms that GDELT is indeed counting events, but only events that are unique to specific publications. So it’s counting events, but with an asterisk. Compounding the matter, the documentation offers no guidance as to what kinds of research questions are appropriate to ask the database or what the limitations might be. People like Simpson who are familiar with the area of research known as event detection may know to not believe (1) the title of the database, (2) the documentation, and (3) the marketing hype. But how would outsiders, let alone newcomers to the platform, ever know that? Here, we’re focusing on GDELT, but the truth is that it’s not very different from any number of other data repositories out there on the web. There are a proliferating number of portals, observatories, and websites that make it possible to download all manner of government, corporate, and scientific data. Consider application programming interfaces (APIs): programs that serve as go-betweens allowing individual users to access data stored by digital platforms. There are APIs that make it possible to write little programs to query massive datasets (like, for instance, all of Twitter) and download them in a structured way. There are test datasets for network analysis, machine learning, social media, and image recognition. There are fun datasets, curious datasets, and newsletters that inform readers of datasets to explore for journalism or analysis: You may enjoy exploring datasets about dogs in Zurich, UFO sightings, or a list of abandoned shopping carts in Bristol rivers. My favorite is perhaps this dataset of all the murals in Brussels inspired by the proud Franco-Belgian comics tradition; in fact, this is such a perfect combination of my personal interests in French, comics, and data that I feel obligated to specify that the original authors of this material included this reference—I didn’t add it after the fact. In our current moment, we tend to think of this unfettered access to information as an inherent good. And in many ways, it is kind of amazing that one can just look up and download data on, for instance, pigeon racing, the length of guinea pig teeth, or every single person accused of witchcraft in Scotland between 1562 and 1736. Personally, I’ve benefited tremendously from this! I’m not exaggerating when I say I owe my career in great part to the ability to download truckloads and truckloads of tweets. (However, under current Twitter—or “X,” I guess—leadership, this ability has disappeared for me and many other researchers.) However, it’s also easy to let this convenient access to data distract us from other important commitments in data science. 14.3 Theory The word theory gets tossed around a lot when discussing science and scientific research, but sometimes people attribute different meanings or values to it. You may have heard someone disparage some scientific conclusion as “just a theory,” suggesting that the word has a flavor of “less than fact.” That’s not entirely wrong, but it’s easy to see how the word theory can—and has—been abused by over-emphasizing that flavor. In response, some scientists and science educators will emphasize that a theory is actually the result of tremendous amounts of scientific inquiry, and theories related to evolution and climate change are much more trustworthy than their detractors would have you believe. This is an appropriate and accurate response, but all of this talk about the truth values associated with theory (as compared to fact) actually sidesteps an important component of what theory actually is—and that component is key to our understanding and use of theory as it pertains to data science. Let’s take a look at a definition from one of my textbooks from grad school to bring our attention to the elements of theory that we care about. Maxwell (2013) suggests that we can understand theory as: a conception or model of what is out there that you plan to study, and of what is going on with these things and why (p. 39) That is, if a phenomenon is a thing we want to study (likely in relationship to other phenomena—that is, other things we want to study), a theory is a description of the relationship between all of those different things. For example, one of my preferred theoretical perspectives is that of literacies (as those of you who have taken my LIS 618 class will remember). In short, this theoretical perspective suggests that people in different contexts use different technologies (or the same technologies in different ways) to express and understand meaning. Thus, when I began my dissertation research and started working with data from 60ish different Twitter hashtags used by teachers in different U.S. states and Canadian provinces or territories, my literacies perspective suggested that there ought to be differences in the activity in those hashtags based on contextual differences. By trying to describe the differences between hashtags, I could get a glimpse at how teachers in different contexts valued different features of Twitter. This example is a good start, but you might notice that this study was pretty descriptive and exploratory—it wasn’t interested in determining a clear cause-effect relationship. In positivist sciences, like data science, a theory isn’t just a relationship between phenomena, it’s a causal relationship between phenomena. More X causes more Y. More X causes more Y, but only if Z remains steady. More X causes more Y, and a combination of more Y and more Z causes more A. Remember that positivist sciences are concerned largely with predictions—theories give us the means by which to make and test predictions. In the context of research, Maxwell (2013) writes that The function of this theory is to inform the rest of your design—to help you to assess and refine your goals, develop realistic and relevant research questions, select appropriate methods, and identify potential validity threats to your conclusions. It also helps you justify your research… (pp. 39-40) In short, if a given theory suggests that more X causes more Y, then as a researcher, your job is to figure out how to measure X, how to measure Y, and what statistical tests can help you determine if more X does indeed cause more Y in the context that you’re doing research in. Your results will then add to our collective understanding of that theory. After all, it is true that a theory isn’t quite the same as fact—especially in the social sciences, theories are always being poked, prodded, tested, challenged, and refined. Theories are necessarily abstract and necessarily make particular assumptions—it’s worth asking (always in good faith) if something important has been abstracted out, or if a given assumption actually holds true. That said, if there’s been a lot of research about a particular theory, then professionals may find it trustworthy enough to make practical decisions based on that theory. If researchers have compellingly demonstrated that more X causes more Y, and if more Y is desired in a particular workplace, then the obvious solution is more X. 14.4 The Importance of Theory To oversimplify things a bit (okay, a lot), the traditional (positivist) research process involves two main phases. In the first phase, researchers collect some data, explore that data, and then use that data to generate a theory. In the second phase, other researchers ask a question, identify a theory that ought to predict the answer to that question, collect data to test that prediction, and publish their results, offering new insights into the theory. In the traditional research process, data is assumed to be difficult to come by, so—as we read earlier—researchers focus their efforts on collecting only that data that the theory directs them to. However, as we’ve discussed in previous weeks, we live in a world in which data is not sparse. In a 2008 Wired article, “The End of Theory,” editor Chris Anderson made the now-infamous claim that “the numbers speak for themselves” (Anderson, 2008). His main assertion was that the advent of big data would soon allow data scientists to conduct analyses at the scale of the entire human population, without needing to restrict their analysis to a smaller sample. To understand his claim, you need to understand one of the basic premises of statistics, which we’ll revisit (though not uncritically) later in the semester. Statistical inference is based on the idea of sampling: that you can infer things about a large-scale phenomenon by studying a random and/or representative sample of people or things making up that phenomenon and then mapping those findings back on the phenomenon as a whole. Say that you want to know who all of the voters in the US will vote for in a coming presidential election. You couldn’t contact all of them, of course, but you could call three thousand of them on the phone and then use those results to predict how the rest of the people would likely vote. There would also need to be some statistical modeling and theory involved, because how do you know that those three thousand people are an accurate representation of the whole population? This is where Anderson made his intervention: at the point at which we have data collected on the entire population, we no longer need modeling or any other “theory” to first test and then prove. We can look directly at the data themselves. Now, you can’t write an article claiming that the basic structure of scientific inquiry is obsolete and not expect some pushback. Anderson wrote the piece to be provocative, and sure enough, it prompted numerous responses and debates, including those that challenge the idea that this argument is a “new” way of thinking in the first place (for example, in the early seventeenth century, Francis Bacon argued for a form of inductive reasoning, in which the scientist gathers data, analyzes them, and only thereafter forms a hypothesis; see Mazzocchi, 2015). Lack of novelty was not the only critique, though. One of Anderson’s major examples is Google Search. Google’s search algorithms don’t need to have a hypothesis about why some websites have more incoming links—other pages that link to the site—than others; they just need a way to determine the number of links so they can use that number to determine the popularity and relevance of the site in search results. We no longer need causation, Anderson (2008) insists: “Correlation is enough.” But what happens when the number of links is also highly correlated with sexist, racist, and pornographic results? The influence of racism, sexism, and colonialism is precisely what we see described in Algorithms of Oppression, information studies scholar Safiya Umoja Noble’s study of the harmful stereotypes about Black and Latinx women perpetuated by search algorithms such as Google’s. Noble demonstrates that Google Search results do not simply correlate with our racist, sexist, and colonialist society; that society causes the racist and sexist results. More than that, Google Search reinforces these oppressive views by ranking results according to how many other sites link to them. The rank order, in turn, encourages users to continue to click on those same sites. Here, correlation without context is clearly not enough because it recirculates racism and sexism and perpetuates inequality. In fact, not only does correlation fail to capture the whole picture, but we can actually use theory to account for the racism, sexism, and colonialism that are associated with Google results! A theoretical perspective that sees technological platforms (like Google) as having specific values (rather than being neutral tools; see van Dijck, 2013) gives us the conceptual tools we need to ask ourselves what the Google software values (say, popularity in the form of hyperlinks) and what it doesn’t actively value (say, anti-racism and feminism). Taking the data at face value—like Anderson would have us do—misses a huge part of what’s going on here. 14.5 Research isn’t Just Empirical Let’s continue along these lines. One of the things that sets scientific research apart is its empiricism. That is, research is empirical—it’s based on data. However, it’s easy to forget that research isn’t just empirical. Scientific research represents a particular branch of philosophy, so to be done properly, we need to have our philosophical caps on, not just our data ones. Berry (2011) argues that the sources of big data we now have access to: provide destabilising amounts of knowledge and information that lack the regulating force of philosophy (p. 8) When we use theory as a guiding force—instead of just relying on data—this helps us consider research from a philosophical point of view. It forces us to state our assumptions out loud and gives us additional means of evaluating research. To give a specific example, let’s consider a Sheriff’s Office in the Tampa, Florida area that received criticism for collecting student information from schools, matching it up with other data, and using data science techniques to predict which students “could ‘fall into a life of crime’” (Bedi &amp; McGrory, 2020). I admittedly don’t know all the details about what this Sheriff’s Office is (was?) doing, and I have a number of objections to this project based on what I do know, but let’s use this story as a starting point for a hypothetical situation. You’ll notice that some of the details I include in this hypothetical example are similar to those I raised when discussing a previous hypothetical example of an algorithm that makes sentencing recommendations for criminals. This isn’t to be redundant but rather to emphasize how widespread these issues are. More data is generally more helpful for making predictions, so if I had the job of predicting future criminals (and I didn’t immediately resign from the job), I would use all the school, county, and other data I could find to start making these predictions. One of the first things I’d do is look at current criminals, collect all the data I could about them, and use that data to determine what to look for in students that might serve as a red flag. Now, let’s imagine that people of color are disproportionately represented among the criminal population of the county I’m in. This could be due to a number of factors, including a relationship between race and socioeconomic status (that is, race predicts socioeconomic status because of centuries of White people enriching themselves at the expense of people of color, and socioeconomic status predicts criminal activity). Alternatively, the local police could be more likely—even unintentionally—to arrest a person of color for something that they would give a White person a pass for (that is, unconscious bias influences patterns of arrest, and patterns of arrest—not patterns of crime—influence demographics of arrests). In short, it would be irresponsible and disgustingly racist to argue that there is something inherent to race that makes a person more likely to be a criminal. Let’s say that these additional factors aren’t accounted for in my data but that my data do say that there are proportionally more people of color in the criminal records that I have access to. As a result, in my number crunching, it’s possible that I come up with a statistically-defensible argument that race predicts criminal activity. If I’m committed to theory, I’m going to have to explicitly argue to my supervisors that I’m operating off of a theoretical perspective that race causes criminal activity. At that point, I would hope that my supervisors would recognize that theory as inexcusably racist, dismiss that as a valid way of predicting future criminal activity, and send me back to the drawing board. However, if I have Anderson-like faith that the data will tell me everything I need to know, that intermediary step of evaluating and justifying the theory may not be necessary. There’s no philosophical oversight of the causal and other relationships that I’m proposing, and it’s easy for terrible decisions to be rubber stamped in the name of objective data. In fact, things get worse: With advanced data science techniques like machine learning, it’s possible to develop a tool that makes predictions but is not transparent about the criteria that it uses to make those predictions. In short, that tool does not allow its “theory” to be evaluated. It’s entirely possible that these tools are based on racist “theory” that is not (or cannot be!) properly evaluated. This ought to worry us. 14.6 The Importance of Context We should also consider the ways that the importance of context pushes back on Anderson’s argument. One of the central tenets of feminist thinking is that all knowledge is situated. A less academic way to put this is that context matters. When approaching any new source of knowledge, whether it be a dataset or dinner menu (or a dataset of dinner menus; see Muñoz &amp; Rawson, 2019), it’s essential to ask questions about the social, cultural, historical, institutional, and material conditions under which that knowledge was produced, as well as about the identities of the people who created it. Rather than seeing knowledge artifacts, like datasets, as raw input that can be simply fed into a statistical analysis or data visualization, a feminist approach insists on connecting data back to the context in which they were produced. This context allows us, as data scientists, to better understand any functional limitations of the data and any associated ethical obligations, as well as how the power and privilege that contributed to their making may be obscuring the truth. The major issue with much of the data that can be downloaded from web portals or through APIs is that they come without context or metadata. If you are lucky, you might get a paragraph about where the data are from or a data dictionary that describes what each column in a particular spreadsheet means, but more often than not, you don’t even get that. Let’s consider an example of data about government procurement. The data may not look very technically complicated, but you still have to figure out how the business process behind them works. How does the government run the bidding process? How does it decide who gets awarded a contract? Are all the bids published here, or just the ones that were awarded contracts? What do terms like competition, cooperation agreement, and terms of collaboration mean to the data publisher? Without answers to even some of these questions—to say nothing of the local knowledge required to understand how power is operating in this particular ecosystem—it would be difficult to even begin a responsible, accurate data exploration or analysis project, even if the data are easily accessible and seem straightforward. This scenario is not uncommon. Most data arrive on our computational doorstep context-free. And this lack of context becomes even more of a liability when accompanied by the kind of marketing hype we see in GDELT and similar projects. In fact, the 1980s version of these claims is what led Donna Haraway to propose the concept of situated knowledge in the first place (see Haraway, 1988). Subsequent feminist work has drawn on the concept of situated knowledge to elaborate ideas about ethics and responsibility in relation to knowledge-making. Along this line of thinking, it becomes the responsibility of the person evaluating that knowledge, or building upon it, to ensure that its “situatedness” is taken into account. For example, information studies scholar Christine Borgman advocates for understanding data in relation to the “knowledge infrastructure” from which they originate. As Borgman (2015) defines it, a knowledge infrastructure is “an ecology of people, practices, technologies, institutions, material objects, and relationships.” In short, it is the context that makes the data possible. There’s another reason that context is necessary for making sense of correlation, and it has to do with how racism, sexism, and other forces of oppression enter into the environments in which data are collected. The next example has to do with sexual assault and violence. If you do not want to read about these topics, you may want to wrap up your reading here. In April 1986, Jeanne Clery, a student at Lehigh University, was sexually assaulted and murdered in her dorm room. Her parents later found out that there had been thirty-eight violent crimes at Lehigh in the prior three years, but nobody had viewed that as important data that should be made available to parents or to the public. The Clerys mounted a campaign to improve data collection and communication efforts related to crimes on college campuses, and it was successful: the Jeanne Clery Act was passed in 1990, requiring all US colleges and universities to make on-campus crime statistics available to the public. So we have an ostensibly comprehensive national dataset about an important public topic. In 2016, three students in Catherine’s D’Ignazio data journalism class at Emerson College—Patrick Torphy, Michaela Halnon, and Jillian Meehan—downloaded the Clery Act data and began to explore it, hoping to better understand the rape culture that has become pervasive on college campuses across the United States. The term rape culture was coined by second-wave feminists in the 1970s to denote a society in which male sexual violence is normalized and pervasive, victims are blamed, and the media exacerbates the problem. Rape culture includes jokes, music, advertising, laws, words, and images that normalize sexual violence. In 2017, following the election of a US president who joked about sexual assault on the campaign trail and the exposé of Harvey Weinstein’s predatory behavior in Hollywood, high-profile women began speaking out against rape culture with the #MeToo hashtag. #MeToo, a movement started over a decade ago by activist Tarana Burke, encourages survivors to break their silence and build solidarity to end sexual violence. These students soon became puzzled, however. Williams College, a small, wealthy liberal arts college in rural Massachusetts, seemed to have an epidemic of sexual assault, whereas Boston University (BU), a large research institution in the center of the city, seemed to have strikingly few cases relative to its size and population (not to mention that several high-profile sexual assault cases at BU had made the news in recent years). The students were suspicious of these numbers, and investigated further. After comparing the Clery Act data with anonymous campus climate surveys, consulting with experts, and interviewing survivors, they discovered, paradoxically, that the truth was closer to the reverse of the picture that the Clery Act data suggested. For example, many of the colleges with higher reported rates of sexual assault were actually places where more institutional resources were being devoted to support for survivors. This is important context, and clearly adds considerations that the original data did not cover. Note, though, that we still need “the regulating force of philosophy” (Berry, 2011, p. 8) to help us puzzle this out. Even with additional context, this data could be interpreted in a number of ways, and philosophy and theory are key for helping us figure out what’s going on here. For example, a bad faith actor might argue that “more support for survivors leads to more sexual assault” and conclude that universities should actually provide less support for survivors. This theory strikes me as unlikely (and irresponsible)—it doesn’t stand up to philosophical inquiry. Rather, it seems much more likely to me that providing more support for survivors creates an environment where people are more comfortable reporting sexual assault. In short, in a faint echo of the GDELT controversy, we have to understand reports of sexual assault as distinct from actual instances of sexual assault. Context, theory, and data are all critical parts of coming to the right conclusion. Indeed, the context and theory that we’ve considered also helps explain the colleges with lower numbers. The Clery Act requires colleges and universities to provide annual reports of sexual assault and other campus crimes, and there are stiff financial penalties for not reporting. But the numbers are self-reported, and there are also strong financial incentives for colleges not to report. No college wants to tell the government—let alone parents of prospective students—that it has a high rate of sexual assault on campus. This is compounded by the fact that survivors of sexual assault often do not want to come forward—because of social stigma, the trauma of reliving their experience, or the resulting lack of social and psychological support. Mainstream culture has taught survivors that their experiences will not be treated with care and that they may in fact face more harm, blame, and trauma if they do come forward. In fact, my undergraduate alma mater—a conservative, religious university—has sometimes interpreted reports of sexual assault as admissions of sexual activity outside of marriage and disciplined survivors instead of supporting them. Is it any surprise that some students might hesitate to report sexual assault? There are further power differentials reflected in the data when race and sexuality are taken into account. For example, in 2014, twenty-three students filed a complaint against Columbia University, alleging that Columbia was systematically mishandling cases of rape and sexual violence reported by LGBTQ students. Zoe Ridolfi-Starr, the lead student named in the complaint, told the Daily Beast, “We see complete lack of knowledge about the specific dynamics of sexual violence in the queer community, even from people who really should be trained in those issues” (Golden, 2014). 14.7 Conclusion Data alone clearly do not show the whole picture, and even context without theory can be misleading. We need all three, and we must not fall into the trap of believing that numbers don’t speak for themselves. 14.8 References Anderson, C. (2008).

Alongside its rapid growth in both size and stature in recent years, data science has become beset by controversies and scrutiny. Machine learning algorithms that guide decisions in areas such as hiring, healthcare, criminal sentencing, and welfare are often biased, inscrutable, and proprietary (Anwin et al., 2016; Buolamwini &amp; Gebru, 2018; Eubanks, 2018; Obermeyer et al., 2019; O’Neil, 2017; Wexler, 2018). Algorithms that drive social media feeds manipulate people’s emotions (Kramer et al., 2014), spread misinformation (Vosoughi et al., 2018), and amplify political extremism (Nicas, 2018). Facilitating these and other algorithms are massive datasets, often gained illicitly or without meaningful consent, that reveal sensitive and intimate information about people (de Montjoye et al., 2015; Kosinski et al., 2013; Rosenberg et al., 2018; Thompson &amp; Warzel, 2019) Many individuals and organizations responded to these controversies by advocating for a focus on ethics in training and practice (Green, 2021). Data ethics represents a growing interdisciplinary effort—both critical and computational—to ensure that the ethical issues brought about by our increasing reliance on data-driven systems are identified and addressed. Thus far, the major trend has been to emphasize the issue of “bias,” and the values of “fairness, accountability, and transparency” in mitigating its effects. The broad motivation behind these efforts is the assumption that, if only data scientists were more attuned to the ethical implications of their work, many harms associated with data science could be avoided. This is a promising development, especially for technical fields that have not historically foregrounded ethical issues, and as funding mechanisms for research on data and ethics proliferate. However, addressing bias in a dataset is a tiny technological Band-Aid for a much larger problem. Even the values of “fairness, accountability, and transparency,” which seek to address instances of bias in data-driven systems, are themselves non-neutral, as they locate the source of the bias in individual people and specific design decisions. In short, these concepts may do good work, but they ultimately keep the roots of the problem in place. In other words, they maintain the current structure of power, even if they don’t intend to, because they let structural issues off the hook. They direct data scientists’ attention toward seeking technological fixes instead of social and political solutions. Sometimes those fixes are necessary and important. But as technology scholars Julia Powles and Helen Nissenbaum (2018) assert, “Bias is real, but it’s also a captivating diversion.” There is a more fundamental problem that must also be addressed: we do not all arrive in the present with equal power or privilege. Hundreds of years of history and politics and culture have brought us to the present moment. This is a reality of our lives as well as our data. 15.3 Ethics vs. Politics In practice, technology ethics suffer from some significant limitations (Green, 2021): First, technology ethics principles are abstract and lack mechanisms to ensure that engineers follow ethical principles. Second, technology ethics has a myopic focus on individual engineers and on technology design, overlooking the structural sources of technological harms. Third, technology ethics is subsumed into corporate logics and practices rather than substantively altering behavior. All told, the rise of technology ethics often reflects a practice dubbed “ethics-washing”: tech companies deploying the language of ethics to resist more structural reforms that would curb their power and profits. Thus, while ethics provides useful frameworks to help data scientists reflect on their practice and the impacts of their work, these approaches are insufficient for generating a data science that avoids social harms and that promotes social justice. The normative responsibilities of data scientists cannot be managed through a narrow professional ethics that lacks normative weight and supposes that, with some reflection and a commitment to best practices, data scientists will make the “right” decisions that lead to “good” technology. Instead of relying on vague moral principles that obscure the structural drivers of injustice, data scientists must engage in politics: the process of negotiating between competing perspectives, values, and goals. In other words, we must recognize data science as a form of political action. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society. In turn, data scientists must evaluate their efforts according to the downstream impacts on people’s lives. In this context, politics and political do not refer to partisan or electoral debates about specific parties and candidates. Instead, these terms have a broader meaning that transcends activity directly pertaining to the government, its laws, and its representatives. Two aspects of politics are particularly important: First, politics is everywhere in the social world. As defined by politics professor Adrian Leftwich (1984), “politics is at the heart of all collective social activity, formal and informal, public and private, in all human groups, institutions, and societies”. Second, politics has a broad reach. Political scientist Harold Lasswell (1936) describes politics as “who gets what, when, how.” The “what” here could mean many things: money, goods, status, influence, respect, rights, and so on. Understood in these terms, politics comprises any activities that affect or make claims about the who, what, when, and how in social groups, both small and large. Data scientists are political actors in that they play an increasingly powerful role in determining the distribution of rights, status, and goods across many social contexts. As data scientists develop tools that inform important social and political decisions—who receives a job offer, what news people see, where police patrols—they shape social outcomes around the world. Data scientists are some of today’s most powerful (and obscured) political actors, structuring how institutions conceive of problems and make decisions. 15.4 Why Politics? This section responds to three arguments that are commonly invoked by data scientists when they are challenged to take political stances regarding their work. These arguments have been expressed in a variety of public and private settings and will be familiar to anyone who has engaged in discussions about the social responsibilities of data scientists. These are by no means the only arguments proffered in this larger debate, nor do they represent any sort of unified position among data scientists. Nonetheless, the three positions considered here are among the most common and compelling arguments made against a politically oriented data science. Any promotion of a more politically engaged data science must contend with them. 15.4.1 Argument 1: “I am Just an Engineer” This first argument represents a common attitude among engineers. In this view, although engineers develop new tools, their work does not determine how a tool will be used. Artifacts are seen as neutral objects that lack any inherent normative character and that can simply be used in good or bad ways. By this logic, engineers bear no responsibility for the impacts of their creations. It is common for data scientists to argue that the impacts of technology are unknowable. However, by articulating their limited role as neutral researchers, data scientists provide themselves with an excuse to abdicate responsibility for the social and political impacts of their work. When a paper that used neural networks to classify crimes as gang-related was challenged for its potentially harmful effects on minority communities, a senior author on the paper deflected responsibility by arguing, “It’s basic research” (Hutson, 2018). Although it is common for engineers to see themselves as separate from politics, many scholars have thoroughly articulated how technology embeds politics and shapes social outcomes. As political theorist Langdon Winner (1986) describes: “technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations. For that reason, the same careful attention one would give to the rules, roles, and relationships of politics must also be given to such things as the building of highways, the creation of television networks, and the tailoring of seemingly insignificant features on new machines. The issues that divide or unite people in society are settled not only in the institutions and practices of politics proper, but also, and less obviously, in tangible arrangements of steel and concrete, wires and semiconductors, and nuts and bolts.” Even though technology does not conform to conventional notions of politics, it often shapes society in much the same way as laws, elections, and judicial opinions. In this sense, “the scientific workplace functions as a key site for the production of social and political order” (Jasanoff, 2003). Thus, as with many other types of scientists, data scientists possess “a source of fresh power that escapes the routine and easy definition of a stated political power” (Latour, 1983). There are many examples of engineers developing and deploying technologies that, by structuring behavior and shifting power, shape aspects of society. As one example, when automobiles were introduced onto city streets in the 1920s, they created chaos and conflict in the existing social order (Norton, 2011). Many cities turned to traffic engineers as “disinterested experts” whose scientific methods could provide a neutral and optimal solution. But the engineers’ solution contained unexamined assumptions and values, namely, that “traffic efficiency worked for the benefit of all”. As traffic engineers changed the timings of traffic signals to enable cars to flow freely, their so-called solution “helped to redefine streets as motor thoroughfares where pedestrians did not belong”. These actions by traffic engineers helped shape the next several decades of automobile-focused urban development in US cities. Although these particular outcomes could be chalked up to unthoughtful design, any decisions that the traffic engineers made would have had some such impact: determining how to time streetlights requires judgments about what outcomes and whose interests to prioritize. Whatever they and the public may have believed, traffic engineers were never “just” engineers optimizing society “for the benefit of all”. Instead, they were engaged in the process—via formulas and signal timings—of defining which street uses should be supported and which should be constrained. The traffic engineers may not have decreed by law that streets were for cars, but their technological intervention assured this outcome by other means. Data scientists today risk repeating this pattern of designing tools with inherently political characters yet largely overlooking their own agency and responsibility. By imagining an artificially limited role for themselves, engineers create an environment of scientific development that requires few moral or political responsibilities. But this conception of engineering has always been a mirage. Developing any technology contributes to the particular “social contract implied by building that technological system in a particular form” (Winner, 1986). Of course, we must also resist placing too much responsibility on data scientists. The point is not that, if only they recognized their social impacts, engineers could themselves solve social issues. Technology is at best just one tool among many for addressing complex social problems (Green, 2019). Nor should we uncritically accept the social influence that data scientists have. Having unelected and unaccountable technical experts make core decisions about governance away from the public eye imperils essential notions of how a democratic society ought to function. As Science, Technology, and Society (STS) scholar Sheila Jasanoff (2006) argues, “The very meaning of democracy increasingly hinges on negotiating the limits of the expert’s power in relation to that of the publics served by technology.” Nonetheless, the design and implementation of technology does rely, at some level, on trained practitioners. This raises several questions that animate the rest of this article. What responsibilities should data scientists bear? How must data scientists reconceptualize their scientific and societal roles in light of these responsibilities? 15.4.2 Argument 2: “We Shouldn’t Take Political Stances” Data scientists adhering to this second argument likely accept the response to Argument 1 but feel stuck, unsure how to appropriately act as more than “just” an engineer. “Sure, I am developing tools that impact people’s lives”, they may acknowledge, before asking, “But is not the best thing to just be as neutral as possible?” Although it is understandable how data scientists come to this position, their desire for neutrality suffers from two important failings. First, neutrality is an unachievable goal, as it is impossible to engage in science or politics without being influenced by one’s background, values, and interests. Second, striving to be neutral is not itself a politically neutral position. Instead, it is a fundamentally conservative one—not in a partisan sense, but in the sense that it is committed to maintaining the status quo. An ethos of objectivity has long been prevalent among scientists. Since the nineteenth century, objectivity has evolved into a set of widespread ethical and normative scientific practices. Conducting good science—and being a good scientist—meant suppressing one’s own perspective so that it would not contaminate the interpretations of observations (Daston &amp; Galison, 2007). Yet this conception of science was always rife with contradictions and oversights. Knowledge is shaped and bounded by the social contexts that generated it. This insight forms the backbone of standpoint theory, which articulates that “nothing in science can be protected from cultural influence—not its methods, its research technologies, its conceptions of nature’s fundamental ordering principles, its other concepts, metaphors, models, narrative structures, or even formal languages” (Harding, 1998). Although scientific standards of objectivity account for certain kinds of individual subjectivity, they are too narrowly construed: “methods for maximizing objectivism have no way of detecting values, interests, discursive resources, and ways of organizing the production of knowledge that first constitute scientific problems, and then select central concepts, hypotheses to be tested, and research designs” (Harding, 1998). Every aspect of science is imbued with the characteristics and interests of those who produce it. This does not invalidate every scientific finding as arbitrary, but it points to science’s contingency and reliance on its practitioners. All research and engineering are developed within particular institutions and cultures and with particular problems and purposes in mind. Just as it is impossible to conduct science in any truly neutral way, there is no such thing as a neutral (or apolitical) approach to politics. As philosopher Roberto Unger (1987) writes, political neutrality is an “illusory and ultimately idolatrous goal” because “no set of practices and institutions can be neutral among conceptions of the good.” Instead of being neutral and apolitical, attempts to be neutral and apolitical embody an implicitly conservative (that is, status quo-preserving) approach. Because neutrality does not mean value-free—it means acquiescence to dominant social and political values, freezing the status quo in place. Neutrality may appear to be apolitical, but that is only because the status quo is taken as a neutral default. Anything that challenges the status quo—which efforts to promote social justice must do by definition—will therefore be seen as political. But efforts for reform are no more political than efforts to resist reform or even the choice simply to not act, both of which preserve existing systems. Although surely not the intent of every scientist and engineer who strives for neutrality, broad cultural conceptions of science as neutral entrench the perspectives of dominant social groups, who are the only ones entitled to legitimate claims of neutrality. For example, many scholars have noted that neutrality is defined by a masculine perspective, making it impossible for women to be seen as objective or for neutral positions to consider female standpoints (Harding, 1998; Lloyd, 1993; Keller, 1985; MacKinnon, 1982). The voices of Black women are particularly subjugated as partisan and anecdotal (Collins, 2000). Because of these perceptions, when people from marginalized groups critique scientific findings, they are cast off as irrational, political, and representing a particular perspective (Haraway, 1988). In contrast, the practices of science and the perspectives of the dominant groups that uphold it are rarely considered to suffer from the same maladies. Data science exists on this political landscape. Whether articulated by their developers or not, machine learning systems already embed political stances. Overlooking this reality merely allows these political judgments to pass without scrutiny, in turn granting data science systems with more credence and legitimacy than they deserve. Predictive policing algorithms offer a particularly pointed example of how striving to remain neutral entrenches and legitimize existing political conditions. The issue is not simply that the training data behind predictive policing algorithms are biased due to a history of overenforcement in minority neighborhoods. In addition, our very definitions of crime and how to address it are the product of racist and classist historical processes. Dating back to the eras of slavery and reconstruction, cultural associations of Black men with criminality have justified extensive police forces with broad powers (Butler, 2017). The War on Drugs, often identified as a significant cause of mass incarceration, emerged out of an explicit agenda by the Nixon administration to target people of color (Alexander, 2012; Baum, 2016). Meanwhile, crimes like wage theft (when employers deny employees wages or benefits to which they are legally entitled) are systemically underenforced by police and do not even register as relevant to conversations about predictive policing—even though wage theft steals more value than other kinds of theft combined (Meixell &amp; Eisenbrey, 2014). Moreover, predictive policing rests on a model of policing that is itself unjust. Predictive policing software could exist only in a society that deploys vast punitive resources to prevent social disorder, following “broken windows” tactics. Policing has always been far from neutral: “the basic nature of the law and the police, since its earliest origins, is to be a tool for managing inequality and maintaining the status quo” (Vitale, 2017). The issues with policing are not flaws of training or methods or “bad apple” officers, but are endemic to policing itself (Butler, 2017; Vitale, 2017). Against this backdrop, choosing to develop predictive policing algorithms is not neutral. Accepting common definitions of crime and how to address it may seem to allow data scientists to remove themselves from politics, but instead upholds historical politics of social hierarchy. Although predictive policing represents a notably salient example of how data science cannot be neutral, the same could be said of all applied data science. Biased data are certainly one piece of the story, but so are existing social and political conditions, definitions and classifications of social problems, and the set of institutions that respond to those problems. None of these factors are neutral and removed from politics. And while data scientists are of course not responsible for creating these aspects of society, they are responsible for choosing how to interact with them. Neutrality in the face of injustice only reinforces that injustice. When engaging with aspects of the world steeped in history and politics, in other words, it is impossible for data scientists to not take political stances. This does not mean that every data scientist should share a singular political vision! That would be wildly unrealistic. It is precisely because the field (and world) hosts a diversity of normative perspectives that we must surface political debates and recognize the role they play in shaping data science practice. Nor is my argument meant to suggest that articulating one’s political commitments is a simple task. Normative ideals can be complex and conflicting, and one’s own principles can evolve over time. Data scientists need not have precise answers about every political question. However, they must act in light of articulated principles and grapple with the uncertainty that surrounds these ideals. 15.4.3 Argument 3: “Don’t Let the Perfect Be the Enemy of the Good” Following the responses to Arguments 1 and 2, data scientists asserting this third argument likely acknowledge that their creations will unavoidably have social impacts and that neutrality is not possible. Yet still holding out against a thorough political engagement, they fall back on a seemingly pragmatic position: because data science tools can improve society in incremental but important ways, we should support their development rather than argue about what a perfect solution might be. Despite being the most sophisticated of the three arguments, this position suffers from several underdeveloped principles. First, data science lacks robust theories regarding what “perfect” and “good” actually entail. As a result, the field typically adopts a superficial approach to reform that involves making vague (almost tautological) claims about what social conditions are desirable. Second, this argument fails to articulate how to evaluate or navigate the relationship between the perfect and the good. Efforts to promote social good thus tend to take for granted that technology-centric incremental reform is an appropriate strategy for social progress. Yet, considered from a perspective of substantive equality and anti-oppression, many data science efforts to do good are not, in fact, consistently doing good. 15.4.3.1 Data Science Lacks a Thorough Definition of “Good” Across the broad world of data science, from academic institutes to conferences to companies to volunteer organizations, “social good” (or just “good”) has become a popular term. While this is both commendable and exciting, the field has not developed (nor even much debated) any working definitions of the term “social good” to guide its efforts. Instead, the field seems to operate on a “know it when you see it” approach, relying on rough proxies such as crime = bad, poverty = bad, and so on. There is, of course, extensive literature (spanning philosophy, STS, and other fields) that considers what is socially desirable, yet data science efforts to promote “social good” rarely reference this literature. This lack of definition leads to “data science for social good” projects that span a wide range of conflicting political orientations. For example, some work under the “social good” umbrella is explicitly developed to enhance police accountability and promote non-punitive alternatives to incarceration (Bauman et al., 2018; Carton et al., 2016). In contrast, other work under the “social good” label aims to enhance police operations. One such paper aimed to classify gang crimes in Los Angeles (Hutson, 2018; Seo et al., 2018) This project involved taking for granted the legitimacy of the Los Angeles Police Department’s gang data—a notoriously biased type of data (Felton, 2018) from a police department that has a long history of abusing minorities in the name of gang suppression (Vitale, 2017). That such politically disparate and conflicting work could be similarly characterized as “social good” should prompt a reconsideration of the core terms and principles. When the term encompasses everything, it means nothing. The point is not that there exists a single optimal definition of “social good”, nor that every data scientist should agree on one set of principles. Instead, there is a multiplicity of perspectives that must be openly acknowledged to surface debates about what “good” actually entails. Currently, however, the field lacks the language and perspective to sufficiently evaluate and debate differing visions of what is “good”. By framing their notions of “good” in such vague and undefined terms, data scientists get to have their cake and eat it too: They can receive praise and publications based on broad claims about solving social challenges while avoiding substantive engagement with social and political impacts. Most dangerously, data science’s vague framing of social good allows those already in power to present their normative judgments about what is “good” as neutral facts that are difficult to challenge. As discussed earlier, neutrality is an impossible goal and attempts to be neutral tend to reinforce the status quo. If the field does not openly debate definitions of “perfect” and “good”, the assumptions and values of dominant groups will tend to win out. Projects that purport to enhance social good but fail to reflexively engage with the political context are likely to reproduce the exact forms of social oppression that many working towards “social good” seek to dismantle. 15.4.3.2 Pursuing an Incremental “Good” Can Reinforce Oppression Even if data scientists acknowledge that “social good” is often poorly defined, they may still adhere to the argument that “we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good”. “After all”, they might say, “is not some solution, however imperfect, better than nothing?” As one paper asserts, “we should not delay solutions over concerns of optimal” outcomes (Sylvester &amp; Raff, 2018). At this point the second failure of Argument 3 becomes clear: It tells us nothing about the relationship between the perfect and the good. Although data scientists generally acknowledge that data science cannot provide perfect solutions to social problems, the field typically takes for granted that incremental reforms using data science contribute to the “social good”. On this logic, we should applaud any attempts to alleviate issues such as crime, poverty, and discrimination. Meanwhile, because “the perfect” represents an unrealizable utopia we should not waste time and energy debating the ideal solution. Although efforts to promote “social good” using data science can be productive, pursuing such applications without a rigorous theory of social change can lead to harmful consequences. A reform that seems desirable from a narrow perspective focused on immediate improvements can be undesirable from a broader perspective focused on long-term, structural reforms. Understood in these terms, the dichotomy between the idealized “perfect” and the incremental “good” is a false one: articulating visions of an ideal society is an essential step for developing and evaluating incremental reforms. In order to rigorously conceive of and compare potential incremental reforms, we must first debate and refine our conceptions of the society we want to create; following those ideals, we can then evaluate whether potential incremental reforms push society in the desired direction. Because there is a multiplicity of imagined “perfects”, which in turn suggest an even larger multiplicity of incremental “goods,” reforms must be evaluated based on what type of society they promote in both the short and long term. In other words, rather than treating any incremental reform as desirable, data scientists must recognize that different incremental reforms can push society down drastically different paths. When attempting to achieve reform, an essential task is to evaluate the relationship between incremental changes and long-term agendas for a more just society. As social philosopher André Gorz (1961) proposes, we must distinguish between “reformist reforms” and “non- reformist reforms.” Gorz explains, “A reformist reform is one which subordinates its objectives to the criteria of rationality and practicability of a given system and policy.” In contrast, a non-reformist reform “is conceived not in terms of what is possible within the framework of a given system and administration, but in view of what should be made possible in terms of human needs and demands.” Reformist and non-reformist reforms are both categories of incremental reform, but they are conceived through distinct processes. Reformist reformers start within existing systems, looking for ways to improve them. In contrast, non-reformist reformers start beyond existing systems, looking for ways to achieve emancipatory social conditions. Because of the distinct ways that these two types of reforms are conceived, the pursuit of one versus the other can lead to widely divergent social and political outcomes. The solutions proposed by data scientists are almost entirely reformist reforms. The standard logic of data science—grounded in accuracy and efficiency—tends toward accepting and working within the parameters of existing systems. Data science interventions are therefore typically proposed to improve the performance of a system rather than to substantively alter it. And while these types of reforms have value under certain conditions, such an ethos of reformist reforms is unequipped to identify and pursue the larger changes that are necessary across many institutions. This approach may even serve to entrench and legitimize the status quo. From the standpoint of existing systems, it is impossible to imagine alternative ways of structuring society—when reform is conceived in this way, “only the most narrow parameters of change are possible and allowable” (Lorde, 1984). In this sense, data science’s dominant strategy of pursuing a reformist, incremental good resembles an algorithm pursuing the strategy of making immediate improvements in the local vicinity of the status quo. Although this strategy can be useful for simple problems, it is unreliable in complex search spaces: We may quickly find a local maximum but will never reach a further-afield terrain of far better solutions. Moves that are immediately beneficial can be counterproductive for finding the global optimum. Similarly, although reformist reforms can lead to certain improvements, a strategy limited to reformist reforms cannot guide robust responses to complex political problems. Reforms that appear desirable within the narrow scope of a reformist strategy can be counterproductive for achieving structural reforms. Even though the optimal political solution is rarely achievable (and is often subject to significant debate), it is necessary to fully characterize the space of possible reforms and to evaluate how reliably different approaches can generate more egalitarian outcomes. The point is not that data science is incapable of improving society. However, data science interventions must be evaluated against alternative reforms as just one of many options, rather than compared merely against the status quo as the only possible reform. There should not be a default presumption that machine learning provides an appropriate reform for every problem. 15.5 Conclusion In sum, attempts by data scientists to avoid politics overlook technology’s social impacts, privilege the status quo, and narrow the range of possible reforms. The field of data science will be unable to meaningfully advance social justice without accepting itself as political. 15.6 References Alexander, M. (2012).

Please navigate to the corresponding discussion board and respond to the following prompt: Earlier in this module, we established that theory and philosophy can play a helpfully constraining role in data science. To be clear, data is tremendously helpful for re-evaluating theory and philosophy, and if the data are telling us something different than our theory and philosophy, that’s something worth paying attention to. Much of the history of science is letting data tell us when and where our philosophical commitments are wrong—the data show that the earth revolves around the sun no matter how committed our philosophy is to keeping the earth at the center of the universe. However, we’ve also established that numbers don’t speak for themselves, and we must also use theory and philosophy to ground and question our findings. For example, even if we found that installing government-run cameras inside citizens’ homes was very helpful for catching criminals, our philosophical commitments to human privacy and dignity ought to tell us that this isn’t an acceptable policy solution. Knowing when to let data override theory and philosophy and when to let theory and philosophy override what the data seem to be telling us is a tricky balance—but we have to be committed to both. In a world where data is increasingly seen as having all the answers, it is especially important that we use theory and philosophy to keep data in check. Think about a professional context—a current job, past job, or hoped-for future job—where you could potentially apply your data science or other research skills. What are the theoretical or philosophical commitments that are widely held in that context? Then think about the ways that those commitments could constrain what data you collect, how you interpret data analysis, and how you would act on data. Are some “data-driven decisions” out of the picture? Is that a good thing? A bad thing? Both? After thinking about these questions, write a short response to this discussion post that addresses some of the answers that you came up with. Focus in particular on how theory and philosophy might provide a helpful constraint when deciding how to use or act on data.

Using census data, the authors reported that income inequality is widening across the nation. San Francisco is leading the pack, with an income gap of almost half a million dollars between the richest and the poorest twenty percent of residents. As in other places, the wealth gap has race and gender dimensions. In the Bay Area, people of color earn sixty-eight cents for every dollar earned by White people, and 59 percent of single mothers live in poverty (National Equity Atlas, 2018). San Francisco also has the lowest proportion of children to adults in any major US city, and—since 2003—an escalating rate of evictions. Although the San Francisco Rent Board collects data on these evictions, it does not track where people go after they are evicted, how many of those people end up homeless, or which landlords are responsible for systematically evicting major blocks of the city. In 2013, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP) stepped in. The initiative is a self-described collective of “housing justice activists, researchers, data nerds, artists, and oral historians.” It is a multiracial group with significant, though not exclusive, project leadership by women. The AEMP is mapping eviction, and doing so through a collaborative, multimodal, and—yes—quite messy process. If you visit antievictionmap.com, you won’t actually find a single map. There are several maps linked from the homepage: maps of displaced residents, of evictions, of tech buses, of property owners, of the Filipino diaspora, of the declining numbers of Black residents in the city, and more. The AEMP has a distinct way of working that is grounded in its stated commitment to antiracist, feminist, and decolonial methodologies (Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, 2016). Most of the projects happen in collaboration with nonprofits and community-based organizations. Additional projects originate from within the collective. For example, the group recently published an atlas of the Bay Area called Counterpoints: A San Fancisco Bay Area Atlas of Displacement &amp; Resistance (Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, 2021), which covers topics such as migration and relocation, gentrification and the prison pipeline, Indigenous and colonial histories of the region, and speculation about the future. One of the AEMP’s longest-standing collaborations is with the Eviction Defense Collaborative (EDC), a nonprofit that provides court representation for people who have been evicted. Although the city does not collect data on the race or income of evictees, the EDC does collect those demographics, and it works with 90 percent of the tenants whose eviction cases end up in San Francisco courts (Eviction Defense Collaborative, 2016). In 2014, the EDC approached the AEMP to help produce its annual report and in return offered to share its demographic data with the organization. Since then, the two groups have continued to work together on EDC annual reports, as well as additional analyses of evictions with a focus on race. The AEMP has also gone on to produce reports with tenants’ rights organizations, timelines of gentrification with Indigenous students, oral histories with grants from anthropology departments, and murals with arts organizations, as well as maps and more maps. Some of the AEMP’s maps are designed to leverage the ability of data visualization to make patterns visible at a glance. For example, the Tech Bus Stop Eviction Map produced in 2014 plots the locations of three years of Ellis Act evictions (Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, n.d.-a). This is a form of “no-fault” eviction in which landlords can claim that they are going out of the rental business. In many cases, this is so that they can convert the building to a condominium and sell the units at significant profit. San Francisco has seen almost five thousand invocations of the Ellis Act since 1994. On the map, the AEMP plotted Ellis Act evictions in relationship to the location of technology company bus stops. Starting in the 2000s, tech companies with campuses in Silicon Valley began offering private luxury buses as a perk to attract employees who wanted to live in downtown San Francisco but didn’t want the hassle of commuting. Colloquially known as “the Google buses” because Google was the most visible company to implement the practice, these vehicles use public bus stops—illegally at first—to shuttle employees to their offices in comfort (and also away from the public transportation system, which would otherwise reap the benefits of their fares; see Solnit, 2013). Because a new, wealthy clientele began to seek condos near the bus stops, property values soared—and so did the rate of evictions of long-time neighborhood residents. The AEMP analysis showed that, between 2011 and 2013, 69 percent of no-fault evictions occurred within four blocks of a tech bus stop. The map makes that finding plain. 17.2 Intentionally Challenging Data Visualization But other AEMP maps are intentionally designed not to depict a clear correlation between evictions and place. In Narratives of Displacement and Resistance (Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, n.d.-a), five thousand evictions are each represented as a differently sized red bubble, so the base map of San Francisco is barely visible underneath. On top of this red sea, sky-blue bubbles dot the locations where the AEMP has conducted interviews with displaced residents, as well as activists, mediamakers, and local historians. Clicking on a blue bubble sets one of the dozens of oral histories in motion—for instance, the story of Phyllis Bowie, a resident facing eviction from her one-bedroom apartment. “I was born and raised in San Francisco proudly,” she begins. Bowie goes on to recall how she returned from the Air Force and worked like crazy for two years at her own small business, building up an income record that would make her eligible for a lease-to-own apartment in Midtown, the historically Black neighborhood where she had grown up. In 2015, however, the city broke the master lease and took away the rent control on her building. Now tenants like Bowie, who moved there with the promise of homeownership, are facing skyrocketing rents that none of them can afford. Bowie is leading rent strikes and organizing the building’s tenants, but their future is uncertain. This uncertainty is carried over into the design of the map, which uses a phenomenon that is often discouraged in data visualization—occlusion—to drive home its point. Occlusion typically refers to the “problem” that occurs when some marks (like the eviction dots) obscure other important features (like the whole geography of the city). But here it underscores the point that there are very few patterns to detect when the entire city is covered in big red eviction bubbles and abundant blue story dots. Put another way, the whole city is a pattern, and that pattern is the problem—much more than a problem of information design. In this way, the Narratives map enacts dissent from San Francisco city policies in the same way that it enacts dissent from the conventions of information design. It refuses both the clarity and cleanliness associated with the best practices of data visualization and the homogenizing and “cleanliness” associated with the forces of gentrification that lead to evictions in the first place (see Naegler, 2012). The visual point of the map is simple and exhortative: there are too many evictions. And there are too many eviction stories. The map does not efficiently reveal how evictions data may be correlated with Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stops, income, Google bus stops, or any other potential dimensions of the data. Even finding the Narratives map is difficult, given the sheer number of maps and visualizations on the AEMP website. There is no “master dashboard” that integrates all the information that the AEMP has collected into a single interface. But all these design choices reinforce the main purpose of the AEMP: to document the effects of displacement and to resist it through critical and creative means. The AEMP thus offers a rich set of examples of feminist counterdata collection and countervisualization strategies. Individually and together, the maps illustrate how Katie Lloyd Thomas, founding member of the feminist art architecture collective taking place, envisions “partiality and contestation” taking place in graphical design. “Rather than tell one ‘true’ story of consensus, [the drawing/graphic] might remember and acknowledge multiple, even contradictory versions of reality,” she explains (Thomas, 2016). The Narratives map populates its landscape with these contradictory realities. It demonstrates that behind each eviction is a person—a person like Bowie, with a unique voice and a unique story. The voices we hear are diverse, multiple, specific, divergent— and deliberately so. In so doing, the Narratives map, and the AEMP more generally, exemplify another feminist principle of data science: embrace pluralism. Embracing pluralism in data science means valuing many perspectives and voices and doing so at all stages of the process—from collection to cleaning to analysis to communication. It also means attending to the ways in which data science methods can inadvertently work to suppress those voices in the service of clarity, cleanliness, and control. Many of our received ideas about data science work against pluralistic meaning-making processes, and one goal of data feminism is to change that. 17.3 Sexy Scientists and… Drab Janitors? Data cleaning holds a special kind of mythos in data science. “It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data,” writes Hadley Wickham (2014) in the first sentence of the abstract of “Tidy Data,” his widely cited paper. Wickham is also the author of the tidyr package for R, which we’ll work with later this week. Wickham’s package shares the sentiment expressed in his paper: that data are inherently messy and need to be tidied and tamed. As we’ve already learned, Wickham went on to create the “tidyverse,” an expanded set of packages that formalize a clear workflow for processing data, which have been developed by a team of equally enthusiastic contributors. Articles in the popular and business press corroborate this insistence on tidiness, as well as its pressing need. In Harvard Business Review, the work of the data scientist is glorified in terms of this tidying function: “At ease in the digital realm, they are able to bring structure to large quantities of formless data and make analysis possible” (Davenport &amp; Patil, 2012). Here, the intrepid analyst wrangles orderly tables from unstructured chaos. According to the article, it’s “the sexiest job of the 21st century.” Along these same lines, people who work with data are often called unicorns (because they are rare and have special skills), wizards (because they can do magic), ninjas (because they execute complicated, expert moves), or rock stars (because they outperform others). However, the data analyst’s work is sometimes described as far less attractive. A 2014 article equated the task of cleaning data to the low-wage maintenance work of “janitors” (Lohr, 2014). This kind of classist comparison overlooks how undervalued the latter kind of work is (whether it’s janitorial or data cleaning). Obtaining good data and/or cleaning up bad data is tedious, repetitive grunt-work. It’s unglamorous, time-consuming, and low-waged. Cleaning data is the equivalent of sterilizing surgical implements–vital, high-skilled, and invisible unless someone fails to do it. It’s work performed by anonymous, low-waged adjuncts to the surgeon, who is the star of the show and who gets credit for the success of the operation. The title of a Google Research team (Sambasivan et al., 2021) paper beautifully summarizes how this is playing out in machine learning, one major application of data science: “Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work: Data cascades in high-stakes AI.” The paper analyzes machine learning failures from a cross-section of high-stakes projects (health diagnostics, anti-poaching, etc) in East Africa, West Africa and India. They trace the failures of these projects to data-quality, and drill into the factors that caused the data problems. The failures stem from a variety of causes. First, data-gathering and cleaning are low-waged, invisible, and thankless work. Front-line workers who produce the data —like medical professionals who have to do extra data-entry—are not compensated for extra work. Often, no one even bothers to explain what the work is for. Some of the data-cleaning workers are atomized pieceworkers, such as those who work for Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, who lack both the context in which the data was gathered and the context for how it will be used. This data is passed to model-builders, who lack related domain expertise. The hastily labeled X-ray of a broken bone, annotated by an unregarded and overworked radiologist, is passed onto a data scientist who knows nothing about broken bones and can’t assess the labels. This is an age-old problem in automation, pre-dating computer science and even computers. The “scientific management” craze that started in the 1880s saw technicians observing skilled workers with stopwatches and clipboards, then restructuring the workers’ jobs by fiat. Rather than engaging in the anthropological, interpretive work that Clifford Geertz called “thick description,” the management “scientists” discarded workers’ qualitative experience, then treated their own positivist assessments as quantitative and thus authoritative. Bad data make bad models. Bad models instruct people to make ineffective or harmful interventions. Those bad interventions produce more bad data, which is fed into more bad models—it’s a “data-cascade.” GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) was already a bedrock of statistical practice before the term was coined in 1957. Statistical analysis and inference cannot proceed from bad data. Producing good data and validating datasets are the kind of unsexy, undercompensated maintenance work that all infrastructure requires—and, as with other kinds of infrastructure, it is undervalued by journals, academic departments, funders, corporations, and governments. But all technological debts accrue punitive interest. The decision to operate on bad data because good data is in short supply isn’t like looking for your car-keys under the lamp-post—it’s like driving with untrustworthy brakes and a dirty windscreen. 17.4 Strangers in the Dataset It’s pretty clear that we ought to value data cleaning more (both in terms of the language we use and the money we pay). Data cleaners must be able to tame the chaos of information overload. They must “scrub” and “cleanse” dirty data. And they must undertake deliberate action—either extraordinary or mundane—to put data back in their proper place. However, it’s also worth being more critical about assumptions and anxieties about the need for tidiness, cleanliness, and order. But what might be lost in the process of dominating and disciplining data? Whose perspectives might be lost in that process? And, conversely, whose perspectives might be additionally imposed? The ideas expressed by Wickham, and by the press, carry the assumption that all data scientists, in all contexts, value cleanliness and control over messiness and complexity. But as the example of the AEMP demonstrates, these are not the requirements, nor the goals, of all data projects. In fact, Rawson and Muñoz (2019) caution that cleaning can function as a “diversity-hiding trick” (p. 290). In the perceived “messiness” of data, there is actually rich information about the circumstances under which it was collected. Data studies scholar Yanni Loukissas (2019) concurs. Rather than talking about datasets, he advocates that we talk about data settings—his term to describe both the technical and the human processes that affect what information is captured in the data collection process and how the data are then structured. As an example of how the data setting matters, Loukissas tells the story of being at a hackathon in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he began to explore a dataset from the Clemson University Library, located in South Carolina. He stumbled across a puzzling record in which the librarian had noted the location of the item as “upstate.” Such a designation is, of course, relational to the place of collection. For South Carolinians, upstate is a very legible term that refers to the westernmost region of the state, where Clemson is located. But it does not hold the same meaning for a person from New York, where upstate refers to its own northern region, nor does it hold the same meaning for a person sitting at a hackathon in Massachusetts, which does not have an upstate part of the state. Had someone at the hackathon written the entry from where they sat, they might have chosen to list the ten or so counties that South Carolinians recognize as upstate, so as to be more clearly legible to a wider geographic audience. But there is meaning conveyed by the term that would not be conveyed by other, more general ways of indicating the same region. Only somebody already located in South Carolina would have referred to that region in that way. From that usage of the term, we can reason that the data were originally collected in South Carolina. This information is not included elsewhere in the library record. It is because of records like this one that the process of cleaning and tidying data can be so complicated and, at times, can be a destructive rather than constructive act. One way to think of it is like chopping off the roots of a tree that connects it to the ground from which it grew. It’s an act that irreversibly separates the data from their context. We might relate the growth of tools like tidyr that help to trim and tidy data to another human intervention into the environment: the proliferation of street names and signs that transformed the landscape of the nineteenth-century United States. Geographer Reuben Rose-Redwood (2008) describes how, for example, prior to the Revolutionary War, very few streets in Manhattan had signs posted at intersections. Street names, such as they existed, were vernacular and related to the particularity of a spot—for example, “Take a right at the red house.” But with the increased mobility of people and things—think of the postal system, the railroads, or the telegraph—street names needed to become systematized. Rose-Redwood calls this the production of “legible urban spaces.” Then, as now, there is high economic value to legible urban spaces, particularly for large corporations (we’re looking at you, Amazon) to deliver boxes of anything and everything directly to people’s front doors. This is a point that Rose-Redwood makes with respect to the nineteenth century as well. It wasn’t just the mail carrier who needed these signs. Rather, the street names were for the “stranger, merchant, or businessman”—this from an 1838 Philadelphia business directory—who came from elsewhere to operationalize a new landscape in the service of their own profit. The point here is that one does not need street names for navigation until one has strangers in the landscape. Likewise, many data do not need cleaning until there are strangers in the dataset. The Clemson University Library dataset was perfectly clear to Clemson’s own librarians. But once hackers in Cambridge get their hands on it, upstate started to make a lot less sense, and it was not at all helpful in producing, for instance, a map of all the library records in the United States. Put more generally, once the data scientists involved in a project are not from within the community, once the place of analysis changes, once the scale of the project shifts, or once a single dataset needs to be combined with others—then we have strangers in the dataset. These rock stars and ninjas are strangers in the dataset because, like the hackers in Cambridge, they often sit at one, two, or many levels removed from the collection and maintenance process of the data that they work with. This is a negative externality—an inadvertent third-party consequence—that arises when working with open data, application programming interfaces (APIs), and the vast stores of training data available online. These data appear available and ready to mobilize, but what they represent is not always well-documented or easily understood by outsiders. Being a stranger in the dataset is not an inherently bad thing, but it carries significant risk of what renowned postcolonial scholar Gayatri Spivak (2010) calls epistemic violence—the harm that dominant groups like colonial powers wreak by privileging their paradigms and ways of knowing over local and Indigenous ways. 17.5 Sharing Work and Sharing Credit This problem is compounded by the belief that data work is a solitary undertaking. This is reflected in the fact that unicorns are unique by definition, and wizards, ninjas, and rock stars are also all people who seem to work alone. This is a fallacy, of course; every rock star requires a backing band, and if we’ve learned anything from Harry Potter, it’s that any particular tap of the wand is the culmination of years of education, training, and support. Wizards, ninjas, rock stars, and janitors each have something else in common: they are assumed to be men. If you doubt this assertion, try doing a Google image search and count how many male-presenting wizards and janitors you see before you get to a single female-presenting one. Or consider why news articles about “data janitors” don’t describe them as doing “cleaning lady” work? Like janitorial work, which is disproportionately undertaken by working-class people of color, the idea of the data ninja also carries racist connotations (Data USA, n.d.; Ti, 2016). And there’s even more: shared among the first four terms—unicorns, wizards, ninjas, rock stars—is a focus on the individual’s extraordinary technical expertise and their ability to prevail when others cannot. We might have more accurately said “his ability to prevail” because these ideas about individual mastery and prevailing against steep odds are, of course, also associated with men. There is a “genius” in the world of eviction data—it is Matthew Desmond, designated as such by the MacArthur Foundation for his work on poverty and eviction in the United States. He is a professor and director of the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, which has been working for several years to compile a national database of evictions and make it available to the general public. Although the federal government collects national data on foreclosures, there is no national database of evictions, something that is desperately needed for the many communities where housing is in crisis. Initially, the Eviction Lab had approached community organizations like the AEMP to request their data. The AEMP wanted to know more—about privacy protections and how the Eviction Lab would keep the data from falling into landlord hands. Instead of continuing the conversation, the Eviction Lab turned to a real estate data broker and purchased data of lower quality. But in an article written by people affiliated with the AEMP and other housing justice organizations, the authors state, “AEMP and Tenants Together have found three-times the amount of evictions in California as Desmond’s Eviction Lab show (Aiello et al., 2018). As Desmond tells it in an interview with Catherine D’Ignazio, this decision was due to a change in the lab’s data collection strategy. “We’re a research lab, so one thing that’s important to us is the data cleaning process. If you want to know does Chicago evict more people than Boston, you’ve got to compare apples to apples.” In Desmond’s view, it is more methodologically sound to compare datasets that have been already aggregated and standardized. And yet Desmond acknowledges that Eviction Lab’s data for the state of California is undercounting evictions; there is even a message on the site that makes that explicit. So here’s an ethical quandary: Does one choose cleaner data at a larger scale that is relatively easy and quick to purchase? Or more accurate data at a local scale for which one has to engage and build trust with community groups? In this case, the priority was placed on speed at the expense of establishing trusted relationships with actors on the ground, and on broad national coverage at the expense of local accuracy. Though the Eviction Lab is doing important work, continued decisions that prioritize speed and comprehensiveness can’t help but maintain the cultural status of the solitary “genius,” effectively downplaying the work of coalitions, communities, and movements that are—not coincidentally—often led primarily by women and people of color. 17.6 Conclusion What might be gained if we not only recognized but also valued the fact that data work involves multiple voices and multiple types of expertise? What if producing new social relationships—increasing community solidarity and enhancing social cohesion—was valued (and funded) as much as acquiring data? This could lead to a multiplication of projects like the AEMP: projects that do demonstrable good with data and do so together with the communities they seek to support. 17.7 References Aiello, D., Bates, L., Graziani, T., Herring, C., Maharawal, M.

However, sometimes the dataset that we’ve found isn’t precisely the data that we need. In this walkthrough, we’ll practice wrangling data and tidying data—two skills that help us transform the data we have into the data we want. 18.2 Wrangling In this section, we’ll cover a series of functions from the dplyr package for data wrangling that will allow you to take a data frame and “wrangle” it (transform it) to suit your needs. Such functions include: filter() a data frame’s existing rows to only pick out a subset of them. mutate() its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, convert hourly temperature recordings from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. arrange() its rows. For example, sort rows of a dataframe in ascending or descending order of a particular variable. join() it with another data frame by matching along a “key” variable. In other words, merge these two data frames together. Notice how I’ve used computer_code font to describe the actions we want to take on our data frames. This is because the dplyr package for data wrangling has intuitively verb-named functions that are easy to remember. There is a further benefit to learning to use the dplyr package for data wrangling: its similarity to the database querying language SQL (pronounced “sequel” or spelled out as “S”, “Q”, “L”). SQL (which stands for “Structured Query Language”) is used to manage large databases quickly and efficiently and is widely used by many institutions with a lot of data. While SQL is a topic left for a book or a course on database management, keep in mind that once you learn dplyr, you can learn SQL more easily. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for our wrangling practice (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(nycflights23) 18.2.1 The pipe operator: |&gt; Before we start data wrangling, let’s first introduce a nifty tool that has been a part of R since May 2021: the native pipe operator |&gt;. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in R into a single sequential chain of actions. In modern R, the native pipe operator |&gt; is now the default for chaining functions, replacing the previously common tidyverse pipe (%&gt;%) that was loaded with the dplyr package. Introduced in R 4.1.0 in May 2021, |&gt; offers a more intuitive and readable syntax for data wrangling and other tasks, eliminating the need for additional package dependencies. You’ll still often see R code using %&gt;% in older scripts or searches online, but we’ll use |&gt; in this class. The tidyverse pipe still works, so don’t worry if you see it in other code. Let’s start with a hypothetical example. Say you would like to perform a hypothetical sequence of operations on a hypothetical data frame x using hypothetical functions f(), g(), and h(): Take x then Use x as an input to a function f() then Use the output of f(x) as an input to a function g() then Use the output of g(f(x)) as an input to a function h() One way to achieve this sequence of operations is by using nesting parentheses as follows: h(g(f(x))) This code isn’t so hard to read since we are applying only three functions: f(), then g(), then h() and each of the functions is short in its name. Further, each of these functions also only has one argument. However, you can imagine that this will get progressively harder to read as the number of functions applied in your sequence increases and the arguments in each function increase as well. This is where the pipe operator |&gt; comes in handy. |&gt; takes the output of one function and then “pipes” it to be the input of the next function. Furthermore, a helpful trick is to read |&gt; as “then” or “and then.” For example, you can obtain the same output as the hypothetical sequence of functions as follows: x |&gt; f() |&gt; g() |&gt; h() You would read this sequence as: Take x then Use this output as the input to the next function f() then Use this output as the input to the next function g() then Use this output as the input to the next function h() So while both approaches achieve the same goal, the latter is much more human-readable because you can clearly read the sequence of operations line-by-line. But what are the hypothetical x, f(), g(), and h()? Throughout this chapter on data wrangling: The starting value x will be a data frame. For example, the flights data frame we explored in Section 6.4. The sequence of functions, here f(), g(), and h(), will mostly be a sequence of any number of the six data-wrangling verb-named functions we listed in the introduction to this chapter. For example, the filter(carrier == \"MQ\") function and argument specified we previewed earlier. The result will be the transformed/modified data frame that you want. In our example, we’ll save the result in a new data frame by using the &lt;- assignment operator with the name alaska_flights via alaska_flights &lt;-. envoy_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(carrier == &quot;AS&quot;) Keep in mind, there are many more advanced data-wrangling functions than just the six listed in the introduction to this chapter; you’ll see some examples of these in Section 18.2.7. However, just with these six verb-named functions you’ll be able to perform a broad array of data-wrangling tasks for the rest of this book. 18.2.2 filter rows Figure 18.1: Diagram of filter() rows operation. The filter() function here works much like the “Filter” option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variable in your dataset and then filters out only the rows that match that criteria. We begin by focusing only on flights from New York City to Phoenix, Arizona. The dest destination code (or airport code) for Phoenix, Arizona is \"PHX\". Run the following and look at the results in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer to ensure that only flights heading to Phoenix are chosen here: phoenix_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(dest == &quot;PHX&quot;) View(phoenix_flights) Note the order of the code. First, take the flights data frame flights then filter() the data frame so that only those where the dest equals \"PHX\" are included. We test for equality using the double equal sign == and not a single equal sign =. In other words, filter(dest = \"PHX\") will yield an error. This is a convention across many programming languages. If you are new to coding, you’ll probably forget to use the double equal sign == a few times before you get the hang of it. You can use other operators beyond just the == operator that tests for equality: &gt; corresponds to “greater than” &lt; corresponds to “less than” &gt;= corresponds to “greater than or equal to” &lt;= corresponds to “less than or equal to” != corresponds to “not equal to.” The ! is used in many programming languages to indicate “not.” Furthermore, you can combine multiple criteria using operators that make comparisons: | corresponds to “or” &amp; corresponds to “and” To see many of these in action, let’s filter flights for all rows that departed from JFK and were heading to Burlington, Vermont (\"BTV\") or Seattle, Washington (\"SEA\") and departed in the months of October, November, or December. Run the following: btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(origin == &quot;JFK&quot; &amp; (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;) &amp; month &gt;= 10) View(btv_sea_flights_fall) Note that even though colloquially speaking one might say “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont and Seattle, Washington,” in terms of computer operations, we really mean “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont or leaving Seattle, Washington.” For a given row in the data, dest can be \"BTV\", or \"SEA\", or something else, but not both \"BTV\" and \"SEA\" at the same time. Furthermore, note the careful use of parentheses around dest == \"BTV\" | dest == \"SEA\". We can often skip the use of &amp; and just separate our conditions with a comma. The previous code will return the identical output btv_sea_flights_fall as the following code: btv_sea_flights_fall &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(origin == &quot;JFK&quot;, (dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;), month &gt;= 10) View(btv_sea_flights_fall) Let’s present another example that uses the ! “not” operator to pick rows that don’t match a criteria. As mentioned earlier, the ! can be read as “not.” Here we are filtering rows corresponding to flights that didn’t go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA. not_BTV_SEA &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(!(dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;)) View(not_BTV_SEA) Again, note the careful use of parentheses around the (dest == \"BTV\" | dest == \"SEA\"). If we didn’t use parentheses as follows: flights |&gt; filter(!dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;SEA&quot;) We would be returning all flights not headed to \"BTV\" or those headed to \"SEA\", which is an entirely different resulting data frame. Now say we have a larger number of airports we want to filter for, say \"SEA\", \"SFO\", \"PHX\", \"BTV\", and \"BDL\". We could continue to use the | (or) operator. many_airports &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(dest == &quot;SEA&quot; | dest == &quot;SFO&quot; | dest == &quot;PHX&quot; | dest == &quot;BTV&quot; | dest == &quot;BDL&quot;) As we progressively include more airports, this will get unwieldy to write. A slightly shorter approach uses the %in% operator along with the c() function. Recall from Subsection 6.2.1 that the c() function “combines” or “concatenates” values into a single vector of values. many_airports &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(dest %in% c(&quot;SEA&quot;, &quot;SFO&quot;, &quot;PHX&quot;, &quot;BTV&quot;, &quot;BDL&quot;)) View(many_airports) What this code is doing is filtering flights for all flights where dest is in the vector of airports c(\"BTV\", \"SEA\", \"PHX\", \"SFO\", \"BDL\"). Both outputs of many_airports are the same, but as you can see the latter takes much less energy to code. The %in% operator is useful for looking for matches commonly in one vector/variable compared to another. As a final note, I recommend that filter() should often be among the first verbs you consider applying to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about; put differently, it narrows down the scope of your data frame to just the observations you care about. 18.2.3 mutate existing variables Figure 18.2: Diagram of mutate() columns. Another common transformation of data is to create/compute new variables based on existing ones as shown in Figure 18.2. For example, say you are more comfortable thinking of temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) instead of degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The formula to convert temperatures from °F to °C is \\[ \\text{temp in C} = \\frac{\\text{temp in F} - 32}{1.8} \\] We can apply this formula to the temp variable using the mutate() function from the dplyr package, which takes existing variables and mutates them to create new ones. weather &lt;- weather |&gt; mutate(temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8) In this code, we mutate() the weather data frame by creating a new variable temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8, and then we overwrite the original weather data frame. Why did we overwrite the data frame weather, instead of assigning the result to a new data frame like weather_new? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing original information that you might need later, it’s acceptable practice to overwrite existing data frames with updated ones, as we did here. On the other hand, why did we not overwrite the variable temp, but instead created a new variable called temp_in_C? Because if we did this, we would have erased the original information contained in temp of temperatures in Fahrenheit that may still be valuable to us. Let’s consider another example. Passengers are often frustrated when their flight departs late, but aren’t as annoyed if, in the end, pilots can make up some time during the flight. This is known in the airline industry as gain, and we will create this variable using the mutate() function: flights &lt;- flights |&gt; mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay) Let’s take a look at only the dep_delay, arr_delay, and the resulting gain variables for the first 5 rows in our updated flights data frame in Table 18.1. Table 18.1: First five rows of departure/arrival delay and gain variables dep_delay arr_delay gain 203 205 -2 78 53 25 47 34 13 173 166 7 228 211 17 The flight in the first row departed 203 minutes late but arrived 205 minutes late, so its “gained time in the air” is a gain of -2 minutes, hence its gain is \\(203 - 205 = -2\\), which is a loss of 2 minutes. On the other hand, the flight in the third row departed late (dep_delay of 47) but arrived 34 minutes late (arr_delay of 34), so its “gained time in the air” is \\(47 - 34 = 13\\) minutes, hence its gain is 13. To close out our discussion on the mutate() function to create new variables, note that we can create multiple new variables at once in the same mutate() code. Furthermore, within the same mutate() code we can refer to new variables we just created. As an example, consider the mutate() code Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund show in Chapter 5 of R for Data Science [@rds2016]: flights &lt;- flights |&gt; mutate( gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, hours = air_time / 60, gain_per_hour = gain / hours ) 18.2.4 arrange and sort rows One of the most commonly performed data-wrangling tasks is to sort a data frame’s rows in the alphanumeric order of one of the variables. The dplyr package’s arrange() function allows us to sort/reorder a data frame’s rows according to the values of the specified variable. Suppose we are interested in determining the most frequent destination airports for all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2023. To do this requires using the group_by() function, which we won’t cover in detail until later, but you should be able to get a sense for what it does and how it fits into everything else here. freq_dest &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(dest) |&gt; summarize(num_flights = n()) freq_dest # A tibble: 118 × 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 ABQ 228 2 ACK 916 3 AGS 20 4 ALB 1581 5 ANC 95 6 ATL 17570 7 AUS 4848 8 AVL 1617 9 AVP 145 10 BDL 701 # ℹ 108 more rows Observe that by default the rows of the resulting freq_dest data frame are sorted in alphabetical order of destination. Say instead we would like to see the same data, but sorted from the most to the least number of flights (num_flights) instead: freq_dest |&gt; arrange(num_flights) # A tibble: 118 × 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 LEX 1 2 AGS 20 3 OGG 20 4 SBN 24 5 HDN 28 6 PNS 71 7 MTJ 77 8 ANC 95 9 VPS 109 10 AVP 145 # ℹ 108 more rows This is, however, the opposite of what we want. The rows are sorted with the least frequent destination airports displayed first. This is because arrange() always returns rows sorted in ascending order by default. To switch the ordering to be in “descending” order instead, we use the desc() function as so: freq_dest |&gt; arrange(desc(num_flights)) # A tibble: 118 × 2 dest num_flights &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 BOS 19036 2 ORD 18200 3 MCO 17756 4 ATL 17570 5 MIA 16076 6 LAX 15968 7 FLL 14239 8 CLT 12866 9 DFW 11675 10 SFO 11651 # ℹ 108 more rows 18.2.5 join data frames Another common data transformation task is “joining” or “merging” two different datasets. For example, in the flights data frame, the variable carrier lists the carrier code for the different flights. While the corresponding airline names for \"UA\" and \"AA\" might be somewhat easy to guess (United and American Airlines), what airlines have codes \"VX\", \"HA\", and \"B6\"? This information is provided in a separate data frame airlines. View(airlines) We see that in airlines, carrier is the carrier code, while name is the full name of the airline company. Using this table, we can see that \"G4\", \"HA\", and \"B6\" correspond to Allegiant Air, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetBlue, respectively. However, wouldn’t it be nice to have all this information in a single data frame instead of two separate data frames? We can do this by “joining” the flights and airlines data frames. The values in the variable carrier in the flights data frame match the values in the variable carrier in the airlines data frame. In this case, we can use the variable carrier as a key variable to match the rows of the two data frames. Key variables are almost always identification variables that uniquely identify the observational units as we saw in Subsection 6.4.4. This ensures that rows in both data frames are appropriately matched during the join. Hadley and Garrett [@rds2016] created the diagram in Figure 18.3 to show how the different data frames in the nycflights23 package are linked by various key variables: Figure 18.3: Data relationships in nycflights from R for Data Science. 18.2.5.1 Matching key variable names In both the flights and airlines data frames, the key variable we want to join/merge/match the rows by has the same name: carrier. Let’s use the inner_join() function to join the two data frames, where the rows will be matched by the variable carrier, and then compare the resulting data frames: flights_joined &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(flights) View(flights_joined) Observe that the flights and flights_joined data frames are identical except that flights_joined has an additional variable name. The values of name correspond to the airline companies’ names as indicated in the airlines data frame. A visual representation of the inner_join() is shown in Figure 18.4 [@rds2016]. There are other types of joins available (such as left_join(), right_join(), outer_join(), and anti_join()), but the inner_join() will solve nearly all of the problems you’ll encounter in this book. Figure 18.4: Diagram of inner join from R for Data Science. 18.2.5.2 Different key variable names Say instead you are interested in the destinations of all domestic flights departing NYC in 2023, and you ask yourself questions like: “What cities are these airports in?”, or “Is \"ORD\" Orlando?”, or “Where is \"FLL\"?”. The airports data frame contains the airport codes for each airport: View(airports) However, if you look at both the airports and flights data frames, you’ll find that the airport codes are in variables that have different names. In airports, the airport code is in faa, whereas in flights the airport codes are in origin and dest. This fact is further highlighted in the visual representation of the relationships between these data frames in Figure 18.3. In order to join these two data frames by airport code, our inner_join() operation will use the by = c(\"dest\" = \"faa\") argument with modified code syntax allowing us to join two data frames where the key variable has a different name: flights_with_airport_names &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) View(flights_with_airport_names) Let’s construct the chain of pipe operators |&gt; that computes the number of flights from NYC to each destination, but also includes information about each destination airport: named_dests &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(dest) |&gt; summarize(num_flights = n()) |&gt; arrange(desc(num_flights)) |&gt; inner_join(airports, by = c(&quot;dest&quot; = &quot;faa&quot;)) |&gt; rename(airport_name = name) named_dests # A tibble: 118 × 9 dest num_flights airport_name lat lon alt tz dst tzone &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 BOS 19036 General Edward L… 42.3643 -71.0052 20 -5 A Amer… 2 ORD 18200 Chicago O&#39;Hare I… 41.9786 -87.9048 672 -6 A Amer… 3 MCO 17756 Orlando Internat… 28.4294 -81.3090 96 -5 A Amer… 4 ATL 17570 Hartsfield Jacks… 33.6367 -84.4281 1026 -5 A Amer… 5 MIA 16076 Miami Internatio… 25.7932 -80.2906 8 -5 A Amer… 6 LAX 15968 Los Angeles Inte… 33.9425 -118.408 125 -8 A Amer… 7 FLL 14239 Fort Lauderdale … 26.0726 -80.1527 9 -5 A Amer… 8 CLT 12866 Charlotte Dougla… 35.2140 -80.9431 748 -5 A Amer… 9 DFW 11675 Dallas Fort Wort… 32.8968 -97.0380 607 -6 A Amer… 10 SFO 11651 San Francisco In… 37.6190 -122.375 13 -8 A Amer… # ℹ 108 more rows In case you didn’t know, \"ORD\" is the airport code of Chicago O’Hare airport and \"FLL\" is the main airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which can be seen in the airport_name variable. 18.2.5.3 Multiple key variables Say instead we want to join two data frames by multiple key variables. For example, in Figure 18.3, we see that in order to join the flights and weather data frames, we need more than one key variable: year, month, day, hour, and origin. This is because the combination of these 5 variables act to uniquely identify each observational unit in the weather data frame: hourly weather recordings at each of the 3 NYC airports. We achieve this by specifying a vector of key variables to join by using the c() function. Recall from Subsection 6.2.1 that c() is short for “combine” or “concatenate.” flights_weather_joined &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(weather, by = c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;origin&quot;)) View(flights_weather_joined) 18.2.6 Normal forms The data frames included in the nycflights23 package are in a form that minimizes redundancy of data. For example, the flights data frame only saves the carrier code of the airline company; it does not include the actual name of the airline. For example, you’ll see that the first row of flights has carrier equal to UA, but it does not include the airline name “United Air Lines Inc.” The names of the airline companies are included in the name variable of the airlines data frame. In order to have the airline company name included in flights, we could join these two data frames as follows: joined_flights &lt;- flights |&gt; inner_join(airlines, by = &quot;carrier&quot;) View(joined_flights) We can perform this join because each of the data frames has keys in common to relate one to another: the carrier variable in both the flights and airlines data frames. The key variable(s) that we base our joins on are often identification variables as we mentioned previously. This is an important property of what’s known as normal forms of data. The process of decomposing data frames into less redundant tables without losing information is called normalization. More information is available on Wikipedia. Both dplyr and SQL we mentioned in the introduction of this chapter use such normal forms. Given that they share such commonalities, once you learn either of these two tools, you can learn the other very easily. 18.2.7 Other verbs Here are some other useful data-wrangling verbs: select() only a subset of variables/columns. relocate() variables/columns to a new position. rename() variables/columns to have new names. Return only the top_n() values of a variable. 18.2.7.1 select variables Figure 18.5: Diagram of select() columns. We’ve seen that the flights data frame in the nycflights23 package contains 19 different variables. You can identify the names of these 19 variables by running the glimpse() function from the dplyr package: glimpse(flights) However, say you only need two of these 19 variables, say carrier and flight. You can select() these two variables: flights |&gt; select(carrier, flight) This function makes it easier to explore large datasets since it allows us to limit the scope to only those variables we care most about. For example, if we select() only a smaller number of variables as is shown in Figure 18.5, it will make viewing the dataset in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer more digestible. Let’s say instead you want to drop, or de-select, certain variables. For example, consider the variable year in the flights data frame. This variable isn’t quite a “variable” because it is always 2023 and hence doesn’t change. Say you want to remove this variable from the data frame. We can deselect year by using the - sign: flights_no_year &lt;- flights |&gt; select(-year) Another way of selecting columns/variables is by specifying a range of columns: flight_arr_times &lt;- flights |&gt; select(month:day, arr_time:sched_arr_time) flight_arr_times This will select() all columns between month and day, as well as between arr_time and sched_arr_time, and drop the rest. The helper functions starts_with(), ends_with(), and contains() can be used to select variables/columns that match those conditions. As examples, flights |&gt; select(starts_with(&quot;a&quot;)) flights |&gt; select(ends_with(&quot;delay&quot;)) flights |&gt; select(contains(&quot;time&quot;)) Lastly, the select() function can also be used to reorder columns when used with the everything() helper function. For example, suppose we want the hour, minute, and time_hour variables to appear immediately after the year, month, and day variables, while not discarding the rest of the variables. In the following code, everything() will pick up all remaining variables: flights_reorder &lt;- flights |&gt; select(year, month, day, hour, minute, time_hour, everything()) glimpse(flights_reorder) 18.2.7.2 relocate variables Another (usually shorter) way to reorder variables is by using the relocate() function. This function allows you to move variables to a new position in the data frame. For example, if we want to move the hour, minute, and time_hour variables to appear immediately after the year, month, and day variables, we can use the following code: flights_relocate &lt;- flights |&gt; relocate(hour, minute, time_hour, .after = day) glimpse(flights_relocate) 18.2.7.3 rename variables One more useful function is rename(), which as you may have guessed changes the name of variables. Suppose we want to only focus on dep_time and arr_time and change dep_time and arr_time to be departure_time and arrival_time instead in the flights_time_new data frame: flights_time_new &lt;- flights |&gt; select(dep_time, arr_time) |&gt; rename(departure_time = dep_time, arrival_time = arr_time) glimpse(flights_time_new) Note that in this case we used a single = sign within the rename(). For example, departure_time = dep_time renames the dep_time variable to have the new name departure_time. This is because we are not testing for equality like we would using ==. Instead we want to assign a new variable departure_time to have the same values as dep_time and then delete the variable dep_time. Note that new dplyr users often forget that the new variable name comes before the equal sign. 18.2.8 top_n values of a variable We can also return the top n values of a variable using the top_n() function. For example, we can return a data frame of the top 10 destination airports using the example from Subsection 18.2.5.2. Observe that we set the number of values to return to n = 10 and wt = num_flights to indicate that we want the rows corresponding to the top 10 values of num_flights. See the help file for top_n() by running ?top_n for more information. named_dests |&gt; top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) Let’s further arrange() these results in descending order of num_flights: named_dests |&gt; top_n(n = 10, wt = num_flights) |&gt; arrange(desc(num_flights)) 18.3 Tidying Data In Subsection 6.2.1, I introduced the concept of a data frame in R: a rectangular spreadsheet-like representation of data where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables describing each observation. In Section 6.4, we started exploring our first data frame: the flights data frame included in the nycflights23 package. In the first section of this walkthrough, we learned how to take existing data frames and transform/modify them to suit our ends. In this second section, we extend some of these ideas by discussing a type of data formatting called “tidy” data. You will see that having data stored in “tidy” format is about more than just what the everyday definition of the term “tidy” might suggest: having your data “neatly organized.” Instead, we define the term “tidy” as it’s used by data scientists who use R, outlining a set of rules by which data is saved. Knowing about tidy data was not necessary earlier because all the data we used were already in “tidy” format. In this walkthrough, we’ll now see that this format is essential to using the tools we’ve covered. Furthermore, it will also be useful for future walkthroughs as we cover future ideas. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this walkthrough (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(dplyr) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(nycflights23) library(fivethirtyeight) library(here) Note that when you load the fivethirtyeight package, you’ll receive the following message: Some larger datasets need to be installed separately, like senators and house_district_forecast. To install these, we recommend you install the fivethirtyeightdata package by running: install.packages(‘fivethirtyeightdata’, repos = ‘https://fivethirtyeightdata.github.io/drat/’, type = ‘source’) This message can be ignored for the purposes of this book, but if you’d like to explore these larger datasets, you can install the fivethirtyeightdata package as suggested. 18.3.1 Importing data Up to this point, most of our activities have used data stored inside of an R package, though we have practiced importing data from an outside source in Section 12.4. It’s time to put that practice to use! To practice tidying data, we need to load a Comma Separated Values .csv file, the same format that I encouraged you to find for your personal dataset. You can think of a .csv file as a bare-bones spreadsheet where: Each line in the file corresponds to one row of data/one observation. Values for each line are separated with commas. In other words, the values of different variables are separated by commas in each row. The first line is often, but not always, a header row indicating the names of the columns/variables. The .csv file we’re interested in here is dem_score.csv—it is found in the activity_data subfolder of your class project folder and contains ratings of the level of democracy in different countries spanning 1952 to 1992. Let’s use the read_csv() function from the readr package (with some help from the @here package) to read it from your computer, import it into R, and save it in a data frame called dem_score. library(readr) dem_score &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;activity_data&quot;,&quot;dem_score.csv&quot;)) dem_score # A tibble: 96 × 10 country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982` `1987` `1992` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Albania -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 -9 5 2 Argentina -9 -1 -1 -9 -9 -9 -8 8 7 3 Armenia -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 7 4 Australia 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 5 Austria 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 6 Azerbaijan -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 1 7 Belarus -9 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 -7 7 8 Belgium 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 Bhutan -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 -10 10 Bolivia -4 -3 -3 -4 -7 -7 8 9 9 # ℹ 86 more rows In this dem_score data frame, the minimum value of -10 corresponds to a highly autocratic nation, whereas a value of 10 corresponds to a highly democratic nation. Note also that backticks surround the different variable names. Variable names in R by default are not allowed to start with a number nor include spaces, but we can get around this fact by surrounding the column name with backticks. We’ll revisit the dem_score data frame in a case study in the upcoming Section 18.3.5. Note that the read_csv() function included in the readr package is different than the read.csv() function that comes installed with R. While the difference in the names might seem trivial (an _ instead of a .), the read_csv() function is, in my opinion, easier to use since it can more easily read data off the web and generally imports data at a much faster speed. Furthermore, the read_csv() function included in the readr saves data frames as tibbles by default. 18.3.2 “Tidy” data With our data imported, let’s learn about the concept of “tidy” data format with a motivating example from the fivethirtyeight package. The fivethirtyeight package provides access to the datasets used in many articles published by the now-slightly-defunct data journalism website, FiveThirtyEight.com. For a complete list of all 129 datasets included in the fivethirtyeight package, check out the package webpage by going to: https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/articles/fivethirtyeight.html. Let’s focus our attention on the drinks data frame and look at its first 5 rows: # A tibble: 5 × 5 country beer_servings spirit_servings wine_servings total_litres_of_pure…¹ &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Afghanistan 0 0 0 0 2 Albania 89 132 54 4.9 3 Algeria 25 0 14 0.7 4 Andorra 245 138 312 12.4 5 Angola 217 57 45 5.9 # ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​total_litres_of_pure_alcohol After reading the help file by running ?drinks, you’ll see that drinks is a data frame containing results from a survey of the average number of servings of beer, spirits, and wine consumed in 193 countries. This data was originally reported on FiveThirtyEight.com in Mona Chalabi’s article: “Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?”. It’s important to note that Chalabi is no longer with FiveThirtyEight and has been sharply critical of the organization since her leaving. Let’s apply some of the data wrangling verbs we learned in Section 18.2 on the drinks data frame: filter() the drinks data frame to only consider 4 countries: the United States, China, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, then select() all columns except total_litres_of_pure_alcohol by using the - sign, then rename() the variables beer_servings, spirit_servings, and wine_servings to beer, spirit, and wine, respectively. and save the resulting data frame in drinks_smaller: drinks_smaller &lt;- drinks |&gt; filter(country %in% c(&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Italy&quot;, &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot;)) |&gt; select(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) |&gt; rename(beer = beer_servings, spirit = spirit_servings, wine = wine_servings) drinks_smaller # A tibble: 4 × 4 country beer spirit wine &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China 79 192 8 2 Italy 85 42 237 3 Saudi Arabia 0 5 0 4 USA 249 158 84 Let’s compare this way of organizing the data with an alternative: drinks_smaller_tidy &lt;- drinks_smaller |&gt; gather(type, servings, -country) drinks_smaller_tidy # A tibble: 12 × 3 country type servings &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China beer 79 2 Italy beer 85 3 Saudi Arabia beer 0 4 USA beer 249 5 China spirit 192 6 Italy spirit 42 7 Saudi Arabia spirit 5 8 USA spirit 158 9 China wine 8 10 Italy wine 237 11 Saudi Arabia wine 0 12 USA wine 84 Observe that while drinks_smaller and drinks_smaller_tidy are both rectangular in shape and contain the same 12 numerical values (3 alcohol types by 4 countries), they are formatted differently. drinks_smaller is formatted in what’s known as “wide” format, whereas drinks_smaller_tidy is formatted in what’s known as “long/narrow” format. In the context of doing data science in R, long/narrow format is also known as “tidy” format. In order to use the packages that we prefer in this class, your input data frames must be in “tidy” format. Thus, all non-“tidy” data must be converted to “tidy” format first. Before we convert non-“tidy” data frames like drinks_smaller to “tidy” data frames like drinks_smaller_tidy, let’s define “tidy” data. 18.3.3 Definition of “tidy” data You have surely heard the word “tidy” in your life: “Tidy up your room!” “Write your homework in a tidy way so it is easier to provide feedback.” Marie Kondo’s best-selling book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing, and Netflix TV series Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. What does it mean for your data to be “tidy”? While “tidy” has a clear English meaning of “organized,” the word “tidy” in data science using R means that your data follows a standardized format. We will follow Hadley Wickham’s (2014) definition of “tidy” data shown also in Figure 18.6: A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings AKA text data (if qualitative/categorical). Values are organised in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a city) across attributes. “Tidy” data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table. Figure 18.6: Tidy data graphic from R for Data Science. For example, say you have the following table of stock prices in Table 18.2: Table 18.2: Stock prices (non-tidy format) Date Boeing stock price Amazon stock price Google stock price 2009-01-01 $173.55 $174.90 $174.34 2009-01-02 $172.61 $171.42 $170.04 Although the data are neatly organized in a rectangular spreadsheet-type format, they do not follow the definition of data in “tidy” format. While there are three variables corresponding to three unique pieces of information (date, stock name, and stock price), there are not three columns. In “tidy” data format, each variable should be its own column, as shown in Table 18.3. Notice that both tables present the same information, but in different formats. Although the data is in a rectangular spreadsheet format, it is not “tidy.” There are three variables (date, stock name, and stock price), but not three separate columns. In tidy data, each variable should have its own column, as shown in Table 18.3. Both tables present the same information, but in different formats. Table 18.3: Stock prices (tidy format) Date Stock Name Stock Price 2009-01-01 Boeing $173.55 2009-01-01 Amazon $174.90 2009-01-01 Google $174.34 2009-01-02 Boeing $172.61 2009-01-02 Amazon $171.42 2009-01-02 Google $170.04 On the other hand, consider the data in Table 18.4. Table 18.4: Example of tidy data Date Boeing Price Weather 2009-01-01 $173.55 Sunny 2009-01-02 $172.61 Overcast In this case, even though the variable “Boeing Price” occurs just like in our non-“tidy” data in Table 18.2, the data is “tidy” since there are three variables for each of three unique pieces of information: Date, Boeing price, and the Weather that day. 18.3.4 Converting to “tidy” data In our walkthroughs so far, you’ve only seen data frames that were already in “tidy” format. Furthermore, for the rest of the semester, you’ll mostly only see data frames that are already in “tidy” format as well. However, this is not always the case with all datasets—including, perhaps, the dataset that you’ve chosen to work with for your class projects. If your original data frame is in wide (non-“tidy”) format and you would like to use the packages we learn about, you will first have to convert it to “tidy” format. (If you’re not sure if your data is tidy, reach out and ask me—I can help you figure this out!) To do so, we recommend using the pivot_longer() function in the tidyr package. Going back to our drinks_smaller data frame from earlier: drinks_smaller # A tibble: 4 × 4 country beer spirit wine &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China 79 192 8 2 Italy 85 42 237 3 Saudi Arabia 0 5 0 4 USA 249 158 84 We convert it to “tidy” format by using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package as follows: drinks_smaller_tidy &lt;- drinks_smaller |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;type&quot;, values_to = &quot;servings&quot;, cols = -country) drinks_smaller_tidy # A tibble: 12 × 3 country type servings &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 China beer 79 2 China spirit 192 3 China wine 8 4 Italy beer 85 5 Italy spirit 42 6 Italy wine 237 7 Saudi Arabia beer 0 8 Saudi Arabia spirit 5 9 Saudi Arabia wine 0 10 USA beer 249 11 USA spirit 158 12 USA wine 84 We set the arguments to pivot_longer() as follows: names_to here corresponds to the name of the variable in the new “tidy”/long data frame that will contain the column names of the original data. Observe how we set names_to = \"type\". In the resulting drinks_smaller_tidy, the column type contains the three types of alcohol beer, spirit, and wine. Since type is a variable name that doesn’t appear in drinks_smaller, we use quotation marks around it. You’ll receive an error if you just use names_to = type here. values_to here is the name of the variable in the new “tidy” data frame that will contain the values of the original data. Observe how we set values_to = \"servings\" since each of the numeric values in each of the beer, wine, and spirit columns of the drinks_smaller data corresponds to a value of servings. In the resulting drinks_smaller_tidy, the column servings contains the 4 \\(\\times\\) 3 = 12 numerical values. Note again that servings doesn’t appear as a variable in drinks_smaller so it again needs quotation marks around it for the values_to argument. The third argument cols is the columns in the drinks_smaller data frame you either want to or don’t want to “tidy.” Observe how we set this to -country indicating that we don’t want to “tidy” the country variable in drinks_smaller and rather only beer, spirit, and wine. Since country is a column that appears in drinks_smaller we don’t put quotation marks around it. The third argument here of cols is a little nuanced, so let’s consider code that’s written slightly differently but that produces the same output: drinks_smaller |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;type&quot;, values_to = &quot;servings&quot;, cols = c(beer, spirit, wine)) Note that the third argument now specifies which columns we want to “tidy” with c(beer, spirit, wine), instead of the columns we don’t want to “tidy” using -country. We use the c() function to create a vector of the columns in drinks_smaller that we’d like to “tidy.” Note that since these three columns appear one after another in the drinks_smaller data frame, we could also do the following for the cols argument: drinks_smaller |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;type&quot;, values_to = &quot;servings&quot;, cols = beer:wine) Converting “wide” format data to “tidy” format often confuses new R users. The only way to learn to get comfortable with the pivot_longer() function is with practice, practice, and more practice using different datasets. For example, run ?pivot_longer and look at the examples in the bottom of the help file. We’ll show another example of using pivot_longer() to convert a “wide” formatted data frame to “tidy” format in Section 18.3.5. 18.3.4.1 nycflights23 package Recall the nycflights23 package we introduced in Section 6.4 with data about all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2023. Let’s revisit the flights data frame by running View(flights). We saw that flights has a rectangular shape, with each of its 435,352 rows corresponding to a flight and each of its 22 columns corresponding to different characteristics/measurements of each flight. This satisfied the first two criteria of the definition of “tidy” data from Subsection 18.3.3: that “Each variable forms a column” and “Each observation forms a row.” But what about the third property of “tidy” data that “Each type of observational unit forms a table”? Recall that we saw in Subsection 6.4.3 that the observational unit for the flights data frame is an individual flight. In other words, the rows of the flights data frame refer to characteristics/measurements of individual flights. Also included in the nycflights23 package are other data frames with their rows representing different observational units [@R-nycflights23]: airlines: translation between two letter IATA carrier codes and airline company names (14 in total). The observational unit is an airline company. planes: aircraft information about each of 4,840 planes used, i.e., the observational unit is an aircraft. weather: hourly meteorological data (about 8,736 observations) for each of the three NYC airports, i.e., the observational unit is an hourly measurement of weather at one of the three airports. airports: airport names and locations. The observational unit is an airport. The organization of the information into these five data frames follows the third “tidy” data property: observations corresponding to the same observational unit should be saved in the same table, i.e., data frame. You could think of this property as the old English expression: “birds of a feather flock together.” 18.3.5 Case study: Democracy in Guatemala In this section, we’ll show you another example of how to convert a data frame that isn’t in “tidy” format (“wide” format) to a data frame that is in “tidy” format (“long/narrow” format). We’ll do this using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package again. Let’s use the dem_score data frame we imported in Section 18.3.1, but focus on only data corresponding to Guatemala. guat_dem &lt;- dem_score |&gt; filter(country == &quot;Guatemala&quot;) guat_dem # A tibble: 1 × 10 country `1952` `1957` `1962` `1967` `1972` `1977` `1982` `1987` `1992` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Guatemala 2 -6 -5 3 1 -3 -7 3 3 Now we are stuck in a predicament, much like with our drinks_smaller example in Section 18.3.2. We see that we have a variable named country, but its only value is \"Guatemala\". We have other variables denoted by different year values. Unfortunately, the guat_dem data frame is not “tidy.” We need to take the values of the columns corresponding to years in guat_dem and convert them into a new “names” variable called year. Furthermore, we need to take the democracy score values in the inside of the data frame and turn them into a new “values” variable called democracy_score. Our resulting data frame will have three columns: country, year, and democracy_score. Recall that the pivot_longer() function in the tidyr package does this for us: guat_dem_tidy &lt;- guat_dem |&gt; pivot_longer(names_to = &quot;year&quot;, values_to = &quot;democracy_score&quot;, cols = -country, names_transform = list(year = as.integer)) guat_dem_tidy # A tibble: 9 × 3 country year democracy_score &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Guatemala 1952 2 2 Guatemala 1957 -6 3 Guatemala 1962 -5 4 Guatemala 1967 3 5 Guatemala 1972 1 6 Guatemala 1977 -3 7 Guatemala 1982 -7 8 Guatemala 1987 3 9 Guatemala 1992 3 We set the arguments to pivot_longer() as follows: names_to is the name of the variable in the new “tidy” data frame that will contain the column names of the original data. Observe how we set names_to = \"year\". In the resulting guat_dem_tidy, the column year contains the years where Guatemala’s democracy scores were measured. values_to is the name of the variable in the new “tidy” data frame that will contain the values of the original data. Observe how we set values_to = \"democracy_score\". In the resulting guat_dem_tidy the column democracy_score contains the 1 \\(\\times\\) 9 = 9 democracy scores as numeric values. The third argument is the columns you either want to or don’t want to “tidy.” Observe how we set this to cols = -country indicating that we don’t want to “tidy” the country variable in guat_dem and rather only variables 1952 through 1992. The last argument of names_transform tells R what type of variable year should be set to. Without specifying that it is an integer as we’ve done here, pivot_longer() will set it to be a character value by default. 18.4 tidyverse package Notice at the beginning of the chapter we loaded the following three packages, which are among the most frequently used R packages for data science: library(dplyr) library(readr) library(tidyr) Recall that dplyr is for data wrangling, readr is for importing spreadsheet data into R, and tidyr is for converting data to “tidy” format. There is a much quicker way to load these packages than by individually loading them: by installing and loading the tidyverse package. The tidyverse package acts as an “umbrella” package whereby installing/loading it will install/load multiple packages at once for you. After installing the tidyverse package as you would a normal package (as seen in Section 6.3), running: library(tidyverse) would be the same as running: library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(purrr) library(tibble) library(stringr) library(forcats) We’ll cover ggplot2 in a future walk through, but the other packages are more than we need in 661. You can check out R for Data Science to learn about these packages. For the remainder of this book, we’ll start every walkthrough by running library(tidyverse), instead of loading the various component packages individually. The tidyverse “umbrella” package gets its name from the fact that all the functions in all its packages are designed to have common inputs and outputs: data frames are in “tidy” format. This standardization of input and output data frames makes transitions between different functions in the different packages as seamless as possible. For more information, check out the tidyverse.org webpage for the package. 18.5 References Grolemund, G., &amp; Wickham, H. (2017). R for Data Science (1st edition).

In the wake of this unconscionable tragedy, and of the additional acts of gun violence that followed, the design firm Periscopic began a new project: to visualize all the gun deaths that took place in the United States over the course of a calendar year. Although there is no shortage of prior work on the subject in the form of bar charts or line graphs, Periscopic, a company with the tagline “Do good with data,” took a different approach. When you load the project’s webpage, you first see a single orange line that arcs up from the x-axis on the left-hand side of the screen. Then, the color abruptly changes to white. A small dot drops down, signifying a death from gun violence, and the age of the victim appears on the screen. The line continues to arc up across the screen and then down, coming back to rest on the x-axis, where a second phrase appears: “Could have lived to be…”, concluded with the life expectancy of that person. Then, a second line appears—the arc of another life. The animation speeds up and the arcs multiply. A counter at the top right displays how many years of life have been “stolen” from these victims of gun violence. After several excruciating minutes, the visualization completes its count for the year the user has picked. I’m writing this just after watching the visualization for 2018: 11,356 people killed, totaling 472,332 stolen years. The visualization uses demographic data and rigorous statistical methods to arrive at these numbers, as is explained in the methods section on the site. But what makes Periscopic’s visualization so very different from a more conventional bar chart of similar information, such as this one from Christopher Ingraham at the Washington Post? The projects share the proposition that gun deaths present a serious threat. But unlike the Washington Post bar chart, Periscopic’s work is framed around an emotion: loss. People are dying; their remaining time on earth has been stolen from them. These people have names and ages. They have parents and partners and children who suffer from that loss as well. This message was clearly received, as was the project overall. It was featured in Wired magazine, and even won an Information is Beautiful award. But it also caused some stewing on the part of the visualization community. Alberto Cairo, the author of the visualization book The Truthful Art, expressed his concerns about the use of emotion and persuasion in the project: “Is it clear to a general audience that what they see is the work of professionals who actively shape data to support a cause, and not the product of automated processes?” (Cairo, 2013). At root for Cairo was the question of how detached and “neutral” a visualization should be. He wondered whether a visualization should be designed to evoke emotion. The received wisdom in technical communication circles is, emphatically, “No.” In the recent book A Unified Theory of Information Design, authors Nicole Amare and Alan Manning (2016) state: “The plain style normally recommended for technical visuals is directed toward a deliberately neutral emotional field, a blank page in effect, upon which viewers are more free to choose their own response to the information.” Here, plainness is equated with the absence of design and thus greater freedom on the part of the viewer to interpret the results for themselves. Things like colors and icons work only to stir up emotions and cloud the viewer’s rational mind. They’re not the first ones to posit this belief. In the field of data communication, any kind of ornament has long been viewed as suspect. Why? As historian of science Theodore Porter (1996) puts it, “Quantification is a technology of distance.” Distance, he further explains, is closely related to objectivity because it puts literal space between people and the knowledge they produce. This desire for separation is what underlies the nineteenth-century statistician Karl Pearson’s exhortation, echoed in Cairo’s comments about the Periscopic visualization, for people to set aside their “own feelings and emotions” when performing statistical work (Gray, 2019). The more plain, the more neutral; the more neutral, the more objective; and the more objective, the more true—or so this line of reasoning goes. 20.2 Persuasion and the God Trick But subjective persuasion is everywhere, even in spreadsheets. In fact, feminist philosopher Donna Haraway (1988) would likely argue that it is especially present in spreadsheets. In the 1980s, Haraway was among the first to connect the seeming neutrality and objectivity of data and their visual display to the ideas about distance that we’ve just discussed. She described data visualization, in particular, as “the god trick of seeing everything from nowhere.” The view from nowhere—from a distance, from up above, like a god—may be data visualization’s most signature feature. It’s also the most ethically complicated to navigate for the ways in which it masks the people, the methods, the questions, and the messiness that lies behind clean lines and geometric shapes. Haraway calls it a trick because it makes the viewer believe that they can see everything, all at once, from an imaginary and impossible standpoint. It’s also a trick because what appears to be everything, and what appears to be neutral, is always what she terms a partial perspective. In most cases of seemingly “neutral” visualizations, this perspective is the one of the dominant, default group. The god trick and its underlying assumptions about neutrality and truth are baked into today’s best practices for data visualization. This is largely due to the influence of one man: the renowned statistical graphics expert Edward Tufte (2015). Back in the 1980s, Tufte invented a metric for measuring the amount of superfluous information included in a chart. He called it the data-ink ratio. In his view, a visualization designer should strive to use ink to display data alone. Any ink devoted to something other than the data themselves—such as background color, iconography, or embellishment—is a suspect and intruder to the graphic. Visual minimalism, according to this logic, appeals to reason first. As police officer Joe Friday says to every woman character on the American TV series Dragnet, “Just the facts, ma’am.” Decorative elements, on the other hand, are associated with messy feelings—or, worse, represent stealthy (and, according to Tufte, unscientific) attempts at emotional persuasion. Data visualization has even been named as “the unempathetic art” by designer Mushon Zer-Aviv (2015) because of its emphatic rejection of emotion. The logic that sets up this false binary between emotion and reason is gendered, of course, because the belief that women are more emotional than men (and, by contrast, that men are more reasoned than women) is one of the most persistent stereotypes across many Western cultures. Indeed, psychologists have called it a master stereotype and puzzled over how it endures even when certain emotions—even extreme ones, like anger and pride—are simultaneously associated with men (see Shields, 2002). A central focus of feminist scholarship has been to challenge false binaries like this one between reason and emotion and to point out how they establish hierarchies as well. We’ll discuss hierarchies and binaries elsewhere, but the important thing to note for now is how false binaries work to benefit a single one of Haraway’s partial perspectives: that of the group already at the top—elite White men. How can we let go of this binary logic? Two additional questions help challenge this reductive way of thinking and the oppressive hierarchies that it supports. First, is visual minimalism really more neutral? And second, how might activating emotion—leveraging, rather than resisting, emotion in data visualization—help us learn, remember, and communicate with data? Exploring these questions helps get us closer to another feminist principle of data science: embrace emotion and embodiment. 20.3 Visualization as Rhetoric Information visualization has diverse origins. Its history is often traced from the explosion of European men mapping their colonial conquests in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, through the development of new visual typologies like the timeline and the bar chart in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to the adoption of those forms by powerful nations as they amassed increasing amounts of data on the populations they sought to control. However, feminist scholars are increasingly challenging this simple narrative of progress, as well as its cast of characters, which is predominantly White and male. Whitney Battle-Baptiste and Britt Rusert (2018) recently published a new edition of the visualization work of W. E. B. Du Bois, the renowned Black sociologist and civil rights activist, who created his “data portraits” of African American life for the 1900 Paris Exposition. Laura Bliss (2016), in a blog post that went viral, called attention to the “narrative maps” of Shanawdithit, a member of the Beothuk (Newfoundland) tribe, which she created around 1829 at the urging of a visiting anthropologist. And Lauren Klein, one of original authors of the material in this reading, created a website that reanimates the historical charts of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, the nineteenth-century editor and educator, who used visualization in her teaching (Klein et al., 2017). Each of these early visualization designers understood how their images could function rhetorically. But in more recent history, many of data visualization’s theorists and practitioners have come from technical disciplines aligned with engineering and computer science and have not been trained in that most fundamental of Western communication theories. In his ancient Greek treatise, Aristotle defines rhetoric as “the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion” (Aristotle, 1954). But rhetoric isn’t only found in political speeches made by men dressed in tunics with wreaths on their heads. Any communicating object that reflects choices about the selection and representation of reality is a rhetorical object. Whether or not it is rhetorical (it always is) has nothing to do with whether or not it is true (it may or may not be). As some of you will remember (or may be interested in), we even discuss the rhetoric of video games (see Bogost, 2008) in my LIS 618 class—if a video game can be rhetorical, then it shouldn’t surprise us that data visualization can as well. The question of rhetoric matters because “a rhetorical dimension is present in every design,” (Hullman &amp; Diakopoulos, 2011). This includes visualizations that do not deliberately intend to persuade people of a certain message. It especially and definitively includes those so-called neutral visualizations that do not appear to have an editorial hand. In fact, those might even be the most perniciously persuasive visualizations of all! 20.4 Editorial Choices in Visualization Editorial choices become most apparent when compared with alternative choices. For example, in his book The Curious Journalist’s Guide to Data, journalist Jonathan Stray (2016) discusses a data story from the New York Times about the September 2012 jobs report. The New York Times created two graphics from the report: one framed from the perspective of Democrats (the party in power at the time) and one framed from the perspective of Republicans. It’s worth taking a pause here to check out the data story before moving on: Seeing the visualizations will be more helpful than simply reading the words that follow. Either of these graphics, considered in isolation, appears to be neutral and factual. The data are presented with standard methods (line chart and area chart respectively) and conventional positionings (time on the x-axis, rates expressed as percentages on the y- axis, title placed above the graphic). There is a high data-ink ratio in both cases and very little in the way of ornamentation. But the graphics have significant editorial differences. The “Democrat” graphic emphasizes that unemployment is decreasing—in its title, the addition of the thick blue arrow pointing downward, and the annotation “Friday’s drop was larger than expected.” In contrast, the “Republican” graphic highlights the fact that unemployment has been steadily high for the past three years— through the use of the “8 percent unemployment” reference line, the choice to use an area chart instead of a line, and, of course, the title of the graphic. Since the 1950s, there has been a line of research focused on the important framing effects of titles of news articles on interpretation. More recently, scholars are showing that titles of visualizations are similarly important anchors for people to make sense of data graphics in popular media (see Borkin et al., 2016). So neither graphic is neutral, but both graphics are factual. As Jonathan Stray (2016) says, “The constraints of truth leave a very wide space for interpretation.” When visualizing data, the only certifiable fact is that it’s impossible to avoid interpretation (unless you simply republish the September jobs report as your visualization, but then it wouldn’t be a visualization). 20.5 Visualization as Ideological Work Fields very close to visualization, like cartography, have long seen their work as ideological. But discussions of rhetoric, editorial choices, and power have been far less frequent in the field of data visualization. In 2011, Hullman and coauthor Nicholas Diakopoulos wrote an influential paper reasserting the importance of rhetoric for the data visualization community (Hullman &amp; Diakopoulos, 2011). Their main argument was that visualizing data involves editorial choices: some things are necessarily highlighted, while others are necessarily obscured. When designers make these choices, they carry along with them framing effects, which is to say they have an impact on how people interpret the graphics and what they take away from them. For example, it is standard practice to cite the source of one’s data. This functions on a practical level—so that readers may go out and download the data themselves. But this choice also functions as what Hullman and Diakopoulos call provenance rhetoric designed to signal the transparency and trustworthiness of the presentation source to end users. Establishing trust between the designers and their audience in turn increases the likelihood that viewers will believe what they see. Other aspects of data visualization also work to displace viewers’ attention from editorial choices to reinforce a graphic’s perceived neutrality and “truthiness.” After doing a sociological analysis, Helen Kennedy and coauthors (2016) determined that four conventions of data visualization reinforce people’s perceptions of its factual basis: (1) two-dimensional viewpoints, (2) clean layouts, (3) geometric shapes and lines, and (4) the inclusion of data sources at the bottom. These conventions contribute to the perception of data visualization as objective, scientific, and neutral. Both unemployment graphics from the New York Times employ these conventions: the image space is two-dimensional and abstract; the layout is “clean,” meaning minimal and lacking embellishment beyond what is necessary to communicate the data; the lines representing employment rates vary smoothly and faithfully against a geometrically gridded background; and the source of the data is noted at the bottom. Either the Democrat or the Republican graphic would have been entirely plausible as a New York Times visualization, and very few of us would have thought to question the graphic’s framing of the data. So if plain, “unemotional” visualizations are not neutral, but are actually extremely persuasive, then what does this mean for the concept of neutrality in general? Scientists and journalists are just some of the people who get nervous and defensive when questions about neutrality and objectivity come up. Auditors and accountants get nervous, too. They often assume that the only alternative to objectivity is a retreat into complete relativism and a world in which alternative facts reign and everyone gets a gold medal for having an opinion. But there are other options. 20.6 Feminist Objectivity Rather than valorizing the neutrality ideal and trying to expunge all human traces from a data product because of their bias, feminist philosophers have proposed a goal of more complete knowledge. Donna Haraway’s (1988) idea of the god trick comes from a larger argument about the importance of developing feminist objectivity. It’s not just data visualization but all forms of knowledge that are situated, she explains, meaning that they are produced by specific people in specific circumstances—cultural, historical, and geographic. Feminist objectivity is a tool that can account for the situated nature of knowledge and can bring together multiple—what she terms partial—perspectives. Sandra Harding (1995), who developed her ideas alongside Haraway, proposes a concept of strong objectivity. This form of objectivity works toward more inclusive knowledge production by centering the perspectives—or standpoints—of groups that are otherwise excluded from knowledge-making processes. This has come to be known as standpoint theory. To supplement these ideas, Linda Alcoff (1988) has introduced the idea of positionality, a concept that emphasizes how individuals come to knowledge-making processes from multiple positions, each determined by culture and context. All of these ideas offer alternatives to the quest for a universal objectivity—which is, of course, an unattainable goal. The belief that universal objectivity should be our goal is harmful because it’s always only partially put into practice. This flawed belief is what provoked renowned cardiologist Dr. Nieca Goldberg (2002) to title her book Women Are Not Small Men because she found that heart disease in women unfolds in a fundamentally different way than in men. The vast majority of scientific studies—not just of heart disease, but of most medical conditions—are conducted on men, with women viewed as varying from this “norm” only by their smaller size (see also Criado-Perez, 2019). The key to fixing this problem is to acknowledge that all science, and indeed all work in the world, is undertaken by individuals. Each person occupies a particular perspective, as Haraway might say; a particular standpoint, as Harding might say; or a particular set of positionalities, as Alcott might say. And all would agree that research by only men and about only men cannot be universalized to make knowledge claims about all other people in the world. Disclosing your subject position(s) is an important feminist strategy for being transparent about the limits of your—or anyone’s—knowledge claims. In an earlier reading, I described a research project I completed with a co-author examining 1,400 tweets associated with a Twitter hashtag claiming to be religious in nature but that our findings show to also be influenced by White nationalism. You may remember that I used this as an example of a research assumption that “different people might come to different conclusions.” Because I’m deeply familiar with the religion in question, and my co-author is not, we see the data differently. Because my co-author has been the target of misogynistic abuse and I have not, we understand certain tweets differently. And yet, even the combination of our two perspectives do not add up to perfect objectivity: For example, both of us are straight, so despite our criticism of homophobic abuse in these tweets, it’s unlikely that we caught everything that a queer researcher would have. With all of this in mind, it was important in our published research to be clear who we were and what perspectives we brought to the table. Rather than viewing these positionalities as threats or as influences that might have biased our work, we embraced them as offering a set of valuable perspectives that could frame our work, while still recognizing that other people with other perspectives may have taken a different approach. This is standard practice in some circles of qualitative researchers, but it would be helpful for data scientists to embrace this approach as well. Each person’s intersecting subject positions are unique, and when applied to data science, they can generate creative and wholly new research questions. 20.7 Data Visceralization This embrace of multiple perspectives and positionalities helps to rebalance the hierarchy of reason over emotion in data visualization. How? Since the early 2000s, there has been an explosion of research about affect—the term that academics use to refer to emotions and other subjective feelings—from fields as diverse as neuroscience, geography, and philosophy. This work challenges the thinking that casts emotion out as irrational and illegitimate, even as it undeniably influences the social, political, and scientific processes of the world. Evelyn Fox Keller, a physicist turned philosopher, famously employed the Nobel Prize–winning research of geneticist Barbara McClintock to show how even the most profound of scientific discoveries are generated from a combination of experiment and insight, reason and emotion (see Keller &amp; McClintock, 1984). Once we embrace the idea of leveraging emotion in data visualization, we can truly appreciate what sets Periscopic’s “US Gun Deaths” graphic apart from the Washington Post graphic or from any number of other gun death charts that have appeared in newspapers and policy documents. The Washington Post graphic, for example, represents death counts as ticks on a generic bar chart. If we didn’t read the caption, we wouldn’t know whether we were counting gun deaths in the United States or haystacks in Kansas or exports from Malaysia or any other statistic. In contrast, the Periscopic visualization leads with loss, grief, and mourning—primarily through its rhetorical emphasis on counting “stolen years.” This draws the attention of viewers to “what could have been.” The counting is reinforced by the visual language for representing the “stolen years” as grey lines, appropriate for numbers that are rigorously determined but not technically facts because they come from a statistical model. The visualization also uses animation and pacing to help us first appreciate the scale of one life, and then compound that scale. The magnitude of the loss, especially when viewed in aggregate and over time, makes a statement of profound truth revealed to us through our own emotions. It is important to note that emotion and visual minimalism are not incompatible here; the Periscopic visualization shows us how emotion can be leveraged alongside visual minimalism for maximal effect. Skilled data artists and designers know these things already, or at least intuit them. Like the Periscopic team, others are pushing the boundaries of what affective and embodied data visualization could look like. In 2010, Kelly Dobson founded the Data Visceralization research group at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) Digital + Media graduate program. The goal for this group was not to visualize data but to visceralize it. Visual things are for the eyes, but visceralizations are representations of data that the whole body can experience, emotionally as well as physically—data that “we see, hear, feel, breathe and even ingest,” writes media theorist Luke Stark (2014). The reasons for visceralizing data have to do with more than simply creative experimentation. First, humans are not two eyeballs attached by stalks to a brain computer. We are embodied, multisensory beings with cultures and memories and appetites. Second, people with visual disabilities need a way to access the data encoded in charts and dashboards as well. According to the World Health Organization (2018), 253 million people globally live with some form of visual impairment, on the spectrum from limited vision to complete blindness. For reasons of accessibility, Aimi Hamraie (2018), the director of the Mapping Access project at Vanderbilt University, advocates for a form of data visceralization, although not in those exact terms: “Rather than relying entirely on visual representations of data,” they explain, “digital-accessibility apps could expand access by incorporating ‘deep mapping,’ or collecting and surfacing information in multiple sensory formats.” At the moment, however, examples of objects and events that make use of multiple sensory formats are more likely to be found in the context of research labs and galleries and museums. For example, in A Sort of Joy (Thousands of Exhausted Things), the theater troupe Elevator Repair Service joined forces with the data visualization firm the Office of Creative Research to script a live performance based on metadata about the artworks held by New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). With 123,951 works in its collection, MoMA’s metadata consists of the names of artists, the titles of artworks, their media formats, and their time periods. But how does an artwork make it into the museum collection to begin with? Major art museums and their collection policies have long been the focus of feminist critique because the question of whose work gets collected translates into the question of whose work is counted in the annals of history. Guerrilla Girls - V&amp;A Museum, London by Eric Huybrechts is licensed CC BY-SA-ND 2.0 As you might guess, this history has mostly consisted of a parade of White male European “masters.” In 1989, the Guerrilla Girls, an anonymous collective of women artists, published an infographic: Do Women Have to Be Naked to Get into the Met. Museum? The graphic makes a data-driven argument by comparing the gender statistics of artists collected by another New York museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) to the gender statistics of the subjects and models in the artworks. It was designed to be displayed on a billboard, but it was rejected by the sign company because it “wasn’t clear enough” (Guerilla Girls, 1995). The data seem pretty clear, though: the Met readily collects paintings in which women are the (naked) subjects but it collects very few artworks created by women artists themselves. After being thwarted by the sign company, the Guerrilla Girls then paid for the infographic to be printed on posters displayed throughout the New York City bus system, until the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) cancelled the contract. A Sort of Joy deploys wholly different tactics to similar ends. The performance starts with a group of White men standing in a circle in the center of the room. They face out toward the audience, which surrounds them. The men are dressed like stereotypical museum visitors: collared shirts, slacks, and so on. Each wears headphones and holds an iPad on which the names of artists in the collection scroll by. “John,” the men say together. We see the iPads scrolling through all the names of the artists in the MoMA collection whose first name is John: John Baldessari, John Cage, John Lennon, John Waters, and so on. Three female performers, also wearing headphones and carrying iPads with scrolling names, pace around the circle of men. “Robert,” the men say together, and the names scroll through the Roberts alphabetically. The women are silent and keep walking. “David,” the men say together. It soon becomes apparent that the artists are sorted by first name, and then ordered by which first name has the most works in the collection. Thus, the Johns and Roberts and Davids come first, because they have the most works in the collection. But Marys have fewer works, and Mohameds and Marías are barely in the register. Several minutes later, after the men say “Michael,” “James,” “George,” “Hans,” “Thomas,” “Walter,” “Edward,” “Yan,” “Joseph,” “Martin,” “Mark,” “José,” “Louis,” “Frank,” “Otto,” “Max,” “Steven,” “Jack,” “Henry,” “Henri,” “Alfred,” “Alexander,” “Carl,” “Andre,” “Harry,” “Roger,” and “Pierre,” “Mary” finally gets her due, spoken by the female performers, the first sound they’ve made. For audience members, the experience is slightly confusing at first. Why are the men in a circle? Why do they randomly speak someone’s name? And why are those women walking around so intently? But “Mary” becomes a kind of aha moment, highlighting the highly gendered nature of the collection—exactly the same kind of experience of insight that data visualization is so good at producing, according to researcher Martin Wattenberg (see Kosara et al., 2009). From that point on, audience members start to listen differently, eagerly awaiting the next female name. It takes more than three minutes for “Mary” to be spoken, and the next female name, “Joan,” doesn’t come for a full minute longer. “Barbara” follows immediately after that, and then the men return to reading: “Werner,” “Tony,” “Marcel,” “Jonathan.” From a data analysis perspective, A Sort of Joy consists of simple operations: counting and grouping. A bar chart or a tree map of first names could easily have represented the same results. But presenting the dataset as a time-based experience makes the audience wait and listen and experience. It also runs counter to the mantra in information visualization expressed by researcher Ben Shneiderman (1996): “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand.” In this data performance, we do not see the overview first. We hear and see and experience each datapoint one at a time and only slowly construct a sense of the whole. The different gender expressions, body movements, and verbal tones of the performers draw our collective attention to the issue of gender in the MoMA collection. We start to anticipate when the next woman’s name will arise. We feel the gender differential, rather than see it. This feeling is affect. It comprises the emotions that arise when experiencing the performance, as well as the physiological reactions to the sounds and movements made by the performers, as well as the desires and drives that result—even if that drive is to walk into another room because the performance is disconcerting or just plain long. Data visceralizations that leverage affect aren’t limited to major art institutions. Catherine D’Ignazio and artist Andi Sutton led walking tours of the future coastline of Boston based on sea level rise (D’Ignazio &amp; Sutton, 2018). Interactive artist Mikhail Mansion (2011) made a leaning, bobbing chair that animatronically shifts based on real-time shifts in river currents. Nonprofit organizations in Tanzania staged a design competition for data-driven clothing that incorporated statistics about gender inequality and closed the project with a fashion runway show (Katuli, 2018). Artist Teri Rueb (2007) stages “sound encounters” between the geologic layers of a landscape and the human body that is affected by them. Simon Elvins (see Green, 2006) drew a giant paper map of pirate radio stations in London that you can actually listen to. A robot designed by Annina Rüst (2013) decorates real pies with pie charts about gender equality, and then visitors eat them. 20.8 Conclusion These projects may seem to be speaking to another part of brain (or belly) than your standard histograms or network maps, but there is something to be learned from the opportunities opened up by visceralizing data. Deliberately embracing emotions like wonder, confusion, humor, and solidarity enables a valuable form of data maximalism, one that allows for multisensory entry points, greater accessibility, and a range of learning preferences. 20.9 References Alcoff, L.

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 21.1 Introduction Let’s continue developing your data science toolbox by exploring data visualization. By visualizing data, we gain valuable insights we couldn’t immediately or easily obtain from just looking at the raw data values. We’ll use the ggplot2 package, as it provides an easy way to customize your plots. ggplot2 is rooted in the data visualization theory known as the grammar of graphics, developed by Leland Wilkinson (2005). However, as we recently covered, ggplot2 is included in the tidyverse package, so we’ll actually load that instead. At their most basic, graphics/plots/charts (you can use these terms more-or-less interchangeably) provide a nice way to explore the patterns in data, such as the presence of outliers, distributions of individual variables, and relationships between groups of variables. Graphics are designed to emphasize the findings and insights you want your audience to understand. This does, however, require a balancing act. On the one hand, you want to highlight as many interesting findings as possible. On the other hand, you don’t want to include so much information that it overwhelms your audience. As we will see, plots also help us to identify patterns and outliers in our data. We’ll see that a common extension of these ideas is to compare the distribution of one numerical variable, such as what are the center and spread of the values, as we go across the levels of a different categorical variable. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). Read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(nycflights23) library(ggplot2) library(moderndive) library(tibble) 21.2 The grammar of graphics Let’s start with a discussion of a theoretical framework for data visualization known as “the grammar of graphics.” This framework serves as the foundation for the ggplot2 package which we’ll use extensively in this walkthrough Think of how we construct and form sentences in English by combining different elements, like nouns, verbs, articles, subjects, objects, etc. We can’t just combine these elements in any arbitrary order; we must do so following a set of rules known as a linguistic grammar. Similarly to a linguistic grammar, “the grammar of graphics” defines a set of rules for constructing statistical graphics by combining different types of layers. This grammar was created by Leland Wilkinson (2005) and has been implemented in a variety of data visualization software platforms like R, but also Plotly and Tableau. 21.2.1 Components of the grammar In short, the grammar tells us that: A statistical graphic is a mapping of data variables to aesthetic attributes of geometric objects. Specifically, we can break a graphic into the following three essential components: data: the dataset containing the variables of interest. geom: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars. aes: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are mapped to variables in the dataset. You might be wondering why I wrote the terms data, geom, and aes in a computer code type font. We’ll see very shortly that we’ll specify the elements of the grammar in R using these terms. However, let’s first break down the grammar with an example. 21.2.2 Gapminder data In February 2006, a Swedish physician and data advocate named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled “The best stats you’ve ever seen” where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website gapminder.org. For example, for data on 142 countries in 2007, let’s consider only a few countries in Table 21.1 as a peek into the data. Table 21.1: Gapminder 2007 Data: First 3 of 142 countries Country Continent Life Expectancy Population GDP per Capita Afghanistan Asia 43.8 31889923 975 Albania Europe 76.4 3600523 5937 Algeria Africa 72.3 33333216 6223 Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns: Country: Name of country. Continent: Which of the five continents the country is part of. Note that “Americas” includes countries in both North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded. Life Expectancy: Life expectancy in years. Population: Number of people living in the country. GDP per Capita: Gross domestic product (in US dollars). Now consider Figure 21.1, which plots this for all 142 of the data’s countries. Figure 21.1: Life expectancy over GDP per capita in 2007. Let’s view this plot through the grammar of graphics: The data variable GDP per Capita gets mapped to the x-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Life Expectancy gets mapped to the y-position aesthetic of the points. The data variable Population gets mapped to the size aesthetic of the points. The data variable Continent gets mapped to the color aesthetic of the points. We’ll see shortly that data corresponds to the particular data frame where our data is saved and that “data variables” correspond to particular columns in the data frame. Furthermore, the type of geometric object considered in this plot are points. That being said, while in this example we are considering points, graphics are not limited to just points. We can also use lines, bars, and other geometric objects. Let’s summarize the three essential components of the grammar in Table 21.2. Table 21.2: Summary of the grammar of graphics for this plot data variable aes geom GDP per Capita x point Life Expectancy y point Population size point Continent color point 21.2.3 Other components There are other components of the grammar of graphics we can control as well. As you start to delve deeper into the grammar of graphics, you’ll start to encounter these topics more frequently. In this book, we’ll keep things simple and only work with these two additional components: faceting breaks up a plot into several plots split by the values of another variable (Section 21.6) position adjustments for barplots (Section 21.8) Other more complex components like scales and coordinate systems are left for a more advanced text such as R for Data Science [@rds2016]. Generally speaking, the grammar of graphics allows for a high degree of customization of plots and also a consistent framework for easily updating and modifying them. 21.2.4 ggplot2 package In this course, we will use the ggplot2 package for data visualization, which is an implementation of the grammar of graphics for R. As we noted earlier, a lot of the previous section was written in a computer code type font. This is because the various components of the grammar of graphics are specified in the ggplot() function included in the ggplot2 package. For the purposes of this book, we’ll always provide the ggplot() function with the following arguments (i.e., inputs) at a minimum: The data frame where the variables exist: the data argument. The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the mapping argument which specifies the aesthetic attributes involved. After we’ve specified these components, we then add layers to the plot using the + sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the layer that specifies which type of geometric object we want the plot to involve: points, lines, bars, and others. Other layers we can add to a plot include the plot title, axes labels, visual themes for the plots, and facets (which we’ll see in Section 21.6). Let’s now put the theory of the grammar of graphics into practice. 21.3 Five named graphs - the 5NG In order to keep things simple in this book, we will only focus on five different types of graphics, each with a commonly given name. We term these “five named graphs” or in abbreviated form, the 5NG: scatterplots linegraphs histograms boxplots barplots I’ll also present some variations of these plots, but with this basic repertoire of five graphics in your toolbox, you can visualize a wide array of different variable types. Note that certain plots are only appropriate for categorical variables, while others are only appropriate for numerical variables. 21.3.1 Scatterplots via geom_point Let’s now go over the code that will create the desired scatterplot, while keeping in mind the grammar of graphics framework we introduced in Section 21.2. Let’s take a look at the code and break it down piece-by-piece. ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point() Within the ggplot() function, we specify two of the components of the grammar of graphics as arguments (i.e., inputs): The data as the envoy_flights data frame via data = envoy_flights. The aesthetic mapping by setting mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay). Specifically, the variable dep_delay maps to the x position aesthetic, while the variable arr_delay maps to the y position. We then add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign. The added layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object. In this case, the geometric object is set to be points by specifying geom_point(). After running these two lines of code in your console, you’ll notice two outputs: a warning message and the graphic shown in Figure 21.2. Figure 21.2: Arrival delays versus departure delays for Envoy Air flights from NYC in 2023. Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range (`geom_point()`). Let’s first unpack the graphic in Figure 21.2. Observe that a positive relationship exists between dep_delay and arr_delay: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase. Observe also the large mass of points clustered near (0, 0), the point indicating flights that neither departed nor arrived late. Let’s turn our attention to the warning message. R is alerting us to the fact that three rows were ignored due to them being missing. For these three rows, either the value for dep_delay or arr_delay or both were missing (recorded in R as NA), and thus these rows were ignored in our plot. Before we continue, let’s make a few more observations about this code that created the scatterplot. Note that the + sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning. You’ll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning of a line. When adding layers to a plot, you are encouraged to start a new line after the + (by pressing the Return/Enter button on your keyboard) so that the code for each layer is on a new line. As we add more and more layers to plots, you’ll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code. To stress the importance of adding the layer specifying the geometric object, consider Figure 21.3 where no layers are added. Because the geometric object was not specified, we have a blank plot that is not very useful! ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) Figure 21.3: A plot with no layers. 21.3.2 Overplotting The large mass of points near (0, 0) in Figure 21.2 can cause some confusion since it is hard to tell the true number of points that are plotted. This is the result of a phenomenon called overplotting. As one may guess, this corresponds to points being plotted on top of each other over and over again. When overplotting occurs, it is difficult to know the number of points being plotted. There are two methods to address the issue of overplotting: adjusting the transparency of the points, or adding a little random “jitter” (or random “nudges”) to each of the points. Method 1: Changing the transparency The first way of addressing overplotting is to change the transparency/opacity of the points by setting the alpha argument in geom_point(). We can change the alpha argument to be any value between 0 and 1, where 0 sets the points to be 100% transparent and 1 sets the points to be 100% opaque. By default, alpha is set to 1. In other words, if we don’t explicitly set an alpha value, R will use alpha = 1. Note how the following code is identical to the code in Section ?? that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with alpha = 0.2 added to the geom_point() function: ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) Figure 21.4: Arrival vs. departure delays scatterplot with alpha = 0.2. The key feature to note in Figure 21.4 is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. Note, furthermore, that there is no aes() surrounding alpha = 0.2. This is because we are not mapping a variable to an aesthetic attribute, but rather merely changing the default setting of alpha. In fact, you’ll receive an error if you try to change the second line to read geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2)). Method 2: Jittering the points The second way of addressing overplotting is by jittering all the points. This means giving each point a small “nudge” in a random direction. You can think of “jittering” as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Let’s illustrate using a simple example first. Say we have a data frame with 4 identical rows of x and y values: (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), and (0,0). In Figure 21.5, we present both the regular scatterplot of these 4 points (on the left) and its jittered counterpart (on the right). Figure 21.5: Regular and jittered scatterplot. In the left-hand regular scatterplot, observe that the 4 points are superimposed on top of each other. While we know there are 4 values being plotted, this fact might not be apparent to others. In the right-hand jittered scatterplot, it is now plainly evident that this plot involves four points since each point is given a random “nudge.” Keep in mind, however, that jittering is strictly a visualization tool; even after creating a jittered scatterplot, the original values saved in the data frame remain unchanged. To create a jittered scatterplot, instead of using geom_point(), we use geom_jitter(). Observe how the following code is very similar to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting in Subsection 21.3.1, but with geom_point() replaced with geom_jitter(). ggplot(data = envoy_flights, mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) + geom_jitter(width = 30, height = 30) Figure 21.6: Arrival versus departure delays jittered scatterplot. In order to specify how much jitter to add, we adjusted the width and height arguments to geom_jitter(). This corresponds to how hard you’d like to shake the plot in horizontal x-axis units and vertical y-axis units, respectively. In this case, both axes are in minutes. How much jitter should we add using the width and height arguments? On the one hand, it is important to add just enough jitter to break any overlap in points, but on the other hand, not so much that we completely alter the original pattern in points. As can be seen in the resulting Figure 21.6, in this case jittering doesn’t really provide much new insight. In this particular case, it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting alpha proved more effective. When would it be better to use a jittered scatterplot? When would it be better to alter the points’ transparency? There is no single right answer that applies to all situations. You need to make a subjective choice and own that choice. At the very least when confronted with overplotting, however, we suggest you make both types of plots and see which one better emphasizes the point you are trying to make. 21.3.3 Summary Scatterplots display the relationship between two numerical variables. They are among the most commonly used plots because they can provide an immediate way to see the trend in one numerical variable versus another. However, if you try to create a scatterplot where either one of the two variables is not numerical, you might get strange results. Be careful! With medium to large datasets, you may need to play around with the different modifications to scatterplots we saw such as changing the transparency/opacity of the points or by jittering the points. This tweaking is often a fun part of data visualization, since you’ll have the chance to see different relationships emerge as you tinker with your plots. 21.4 5NG#2: Linegraphs The next of the five named graphs are linegraphs. Linegraphs show the relationship between two numerical variables when the variable on the x-axis, also called the explanatory variable, is of a sequential nature. In other words, there is an inherent ordering to the variable. The most common examples of linegraphs have some notion of time on the x-axis: hours, days, weeks, years, etc. Since time is sequential, we connect consecutive observations of the variable on the y-axis with a line. Linegraphs that have some notion of time on the x-axis are also called time series plots. Let’s illustrate linegraphs using another dataset in the nycflights23 package: the weather data frame. Let’s explore the weather data frame from the nycflights23 package by running View(weather) and glimpse(weather). Furthermore, let’s read the associated help file by running ?weather to bring up the help file. Observe that there is a variable called wind_speed of hourly wind speed recordings in miles per hour at weather stations near all three major airports in New York City: Newark (origin code EWR), John F. Kennedy International (JFK), and LaGuardia (LGA). However, instead of considering hourly wind speeds for all days in 2023 for all three airports, for simplicity let’s only consider hourly wind speeds at Newark airport for the first 15 days in January. This data is accessible in the early_january_2023_weather data frame included in the moderndive package. In other words, early_january_2023_weather contains hourly weather observations for origin equal to EWR (Newark’s airport code), month equal to 1, and day less than or equal to 15. 21.4.1 Linegraphs via geom_line Let’s create a time series plot (as seen in Figure 21.7) of the hourly wind speeds saved in the early_january_2023_weather data frame by using geom_line() to create a linegraph, instead of using geom_point() like we used previously to create scatterplots: ggplot(data = early_january_2023_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = wind_speed)) + geom_line() Figure 21.7: Hourly wind speed in Newark for January 1-15, 2023. Much as with the ggplot() code that created the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Envoy Air flights in Figure 21.2, let’s break down this code piece-by-piece in terms of the grammar of graphics: Within the ggplot() function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar of graphics as arguments: The data to be the early_january_2023_weather data frame by setting data = early_january_2023_weather. The aesthetic mapping by setting mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp). Specifically, the variable time_hour maps to the x position aesthetic, while the variable wind_speed maps to the y position aesthetic. We add a layer to the ggplot() function call using the + sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the geometric object in question. In this case, the geometric object is a line set by specifying geom_line(). 21.5 5NG#3: Histograms Let’s consider the wind_speed variable in the weather data frame once again, but unlike with the linegraphs in Section 21.4, let’s say we don’t care about its relationship with time, but rather we only care about how the values of wind_speed distribute. In other words: What are the smallest and largest values? What is the “center” or “most typical” value? How do the values spread out? What are frequent and infrequent values? One way to visualize this distribution of this single variable wind_speed is to plot them on a horizontal line as we do in Figure 21.8: Figure 21.8: Plot of hourly wind speed recordings from NYC in 2023. This gives us a general idea of how the values of wind_speed distribute: observe that wind speeds vary from around 0 miles per hour (0 kilometers per hour ) up to 38 miles per hour (approximately 61 kilometers per hour). There appear to be more recorded wind speeds between 0 and 20 miles per hour (mph) than outside this range. However, because of the high degree of overplotting in the points, it’s hard to get a sense of exactly how many values are between, say, 10 mph and 15 mph. What is commonly produced instead of Figure 21.8 is known as a histogram. A histogram is a plot that visualizes the distribution of a numerical value as follows: We first cut up the x-axis into a series of bins, where each bin represents a range of values. For each bin, we count the number of observations that fall in the range corresponding to that bin. Then for each bin, we draw a bar whose height marks the corresponding count. Let’s drill-down on an example of a histogram, shown in Figure 21.9. Figure 21.9: Example histogram. Let’s focus only on wind speeds between 10 mph and 25 mph for now. Observe that there are three bins of equal width between 10 mph and 25 mph. Thus we have three bins of width 5 mph each: one bin for the 10-15 mph range, another bin for the 15-20 mph range, and another bin for the 20-25 mph range. Since: The bin for the 10-15 mph range has a height of around 8000. In other words, around 8000 of the hourly wind speed recordings are between 10 mph and 15 mph. The bin for the 15-20 mph range has a height of around 2400. In other words, around 2400 of the hourly wind speed recordings are between 15 mph and 20 mph. The bin for the 20-25 mph range has a height of around 700. In other words, around 700 of the hourly wind speed recordings are between 20 mph and 25 mph. All eight bins spanning 0 mph to 40 mph on the x-axis have this interpretation. 21.5.1 Histograms via geom_histogram Let’s now present the ggplot() code to plot your first histogram! Unlike with scatterplots and linegraphs, there is now only one variable being mapped in aes(): the single numerical variable wind_speed. The y-aesthetic of a histogram, the count of the observations in each bin, gets computed for you automatically. Furthermore, the geometric object layer is now a geom_histogram(). After running the following code, you’ll see the histogram in Figure 21.10 as well as warning messages. We’ll discuss the warning messages first. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram() Figure 21.10: Histogram of hourly wind speeds at three NYC airports. `stat_bin()` using `bins=30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Warning: Removed 1033 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range (`stat_bin()`). The first message is telling us that the histogram was constructed using bins = 30 for 30 equally spaced bins. This is known in computer programming as a default value; unless you override this default number of bins with a number you specify, R will choose 30 by default. We’ll see in the next section how to change the number of bins to another value than the default. The second warning message is telling us something similar to the warning message we received when we ran the code to create a scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Envoy Air flights in Figure 21.2: that because some rows have missing NA value for wind_speed, they were omitted from the histogram. R is just giving us a friendly heads-up that this was the case. Now let’s unpack the resulting histogram in Figure 21.10. Observe that values above 30 mph are rather rare. However, because of the large number of bins, it’s hard to get a sense for which range of wind speeds is spanned by each bin; everything is one giant amorphous blob. So let’s add white vertical borders demarcating the bins by adding a color = \"white\" argument to geom_histogram() and ignore the warning about setting the number of bins to a better value: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;) Figure 21.11: Histogram of hourly wind speeds at three NYC airports with white borders. We now have an easier time associating ranges of wind speeds to each of the bins in Figure 21.11. We can also vary the color of the bars by setting the fill argument. For example, you can set the bin colors to be “blue steel” by setting fill = \"steelblue\": ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, fill = &quot;steelblue&quot;) If you’re curious, run colors() to see all 657 possible choice of colors in R! 21.5.2 Adjusting the bins Observe in Figure 21.11 that in the 10-20 mph range there appear to be roughly 8 bins. Thus each bin has width 10 divided by 8, or 1.125 mph, which is not a very easily interpretable range to work with. Let’s improve this by adjusting the number of bins in our histogram in one of two ways: By adjusting the number of bins via the bins argument to geom_histogram(). By adjusting the width of the bins via the binwidth argument to geom_histogram(). Using the first method, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to cut the x-axis up in. As mentioned in the previous section, the default number of bins is 20. We can override this default, to say 20 bins, as follows: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = &quot;white&quot;) Using the second method, instead of specifying the number of bins, we specify the width of the bins by using the binwidth argument in the geom_histogram() layer. For example, let’s set the width of each bin to be five mph. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) We compare both resulting histograms side-by-side in Figure 21.12. Figure 21.12: Setting histogram bins in two ways. 21.5.3 Summary Histograms, unlike scatterplots and linegraphs, present information on only a single numerical variable. Specifically, they are visualizations of the distribution of the numerical variable in question. 21.6 Facets Before continuing with the next of the 5NG, let’s briefly introduce a new concept called faceting. Faceting is used when we’d like to split a particular visualization by the values of another variable. This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ. For example, suppose we were interested in looking at how the histogram of hourly wind speed recordings at the three NYC airports we saw in Figure 21.9 differed in each month. We could “split” this histogram by the 12 possible months in a given year. In other words, we would plot histograms of wind_speed for each month separately. We do this by adding facet_wrap(~ month) layer. Note the ~ is a “tilde” and can generally be found on the key next to the “1” key on US keyboards. The tilde is required and you’ll receive the error Error in as.quoted(facets) : object 'month' not found if you don’t include it here. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ month) Figure 21.13: Faceted histogram of hourly wind speeds by month. We can also specify the number of rows and columns in the grid by using the nrow and ncol arguments inside of facet_wrap(). For example, say we would like our faceted histogram to have 4 rows instead of 3. We simply add an nrow = 4 argument to facet_wrap(~ month). ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ month, nrow = 4) Figure 21.14: Faceted histogram with 4 instead of 3 rows. Observe in both Figures 21.13 and 21.14 the majority of wind speed observations for all months are clustered between 0 and 20 mph, with very few observations exceeding 30 mph. The histograms show a similar shape across months, with most distributions having a similar largest count and a few larger speed outliers, indicating that lower wind speeds are more common than higher wind speeds. 21.7 5NG#4: Boxplots While faceted histograms are one type of visualization used to compare the distribution of a numerical variable split by the values of another variable, another type of visualization that achieves this same goal is a side-by-side boxplot. A boxplot is constructed from the information provided in the five-number summary of a numerical variable. This is a preview of next week’s walkthrough about descriptive statistics! To keep things simple for now, let’s only consider the 2057 recorded hourly wind speed recordings for the month of April, each represented as a jittered point in Figure 21.15. Figure 21.15: April wind speeds represented as jittered points. These 2057 observations have the following five-number summary: Minimum: 0 mph First quartile (25th percentile): 5.8 mph Median (second quartile, 50th percentile): 9.2 mph Third quartile (75th percentile): 12.7 mph Maximum: 29.92 mph In the leftmost plot of Figure 21.16, let’s mark these 5 values with dashed horizontal lines on top of the 2057 points. In the middle plot of Figure 21.16 let’s add the boxplot. In the rightmost plot of Figure 21.16, let’s remove the points and the dashed horizontal lines for clarity’s sake. Figure 21.16: Building up a boxplot of April wind speeds. What the boxplot does is visually summarize the 2057 points by cutting the wind speed recordings into quartiles at the dashed lines, where each quartile contains roughly 2057 \\(\\div\\) 4 \\(\\approx\\) 514 observations. Thus 25% of points fall below the bottom edge of the box, which is the first quartile of 5.8 mph. In other words, 25% of observations were below 5.8 mph. 25% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line, which is the median of 9.2 mph. Thus, 25% of observations were between 5.8 mph and 9.2 mph and 50% of observations were below 9.2 mph. 25% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box, which is the third quartile of 12.7 mph. It follows that 25% of observations were between 9.2 mph and 12.7 mph and 75% of observations were below 12.7 mph. 25% of points fall above the top edge of the box. In other words, 25% of observations were above 12.7 mph. The middle 50% of points lie within the interquartile range (IQR) between the first and third quartile. Thus, the IQR for this example is 12.7 - 5.8 = 6.905 mph. The interquartile range measures a numerical variable’s spread. Furthermore, in the rightmost plot of Figure 21.16, we see the whiskers of the boxplot. The whiskers stick out from either end of the box all the way to the minimum and maximum observed wind speeds of 0 mph and 29.92 mph, respectively. However, the whiskers don’t always extend to the smallest and largest observed values as they do here. They in fact extend no more than 1.5 \\(\\times\\) the interquartile range from either end of the box, in this case of the April wind speeds, no more than 1.5 \\(\\times\\) 6.905 mph = 10.357 mph from either end of the box. Any observed values outside this range get marked with points called outliers, which are marked here, and we’ll discuss further in the next section. 21.7.1 Boxplots via geom_boxplot Let’s now create a side-by-side boxplot of hourly wind speeds split by the 12 months as we did previously with the faceted histograms. We do this by mapping the month variable to the x-position aesthetic, the wind_speed variable to the y-position aesthetic, and by adding a geom_boxplot() layer: ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = wind_speed)) + geom_boxplot() Figure 21.17: Invalid boxplot specification. Warning message: 1: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)? Observe in Figure 21.17 that this plot does not provide information about wind speed separated by month. The first warning message tells us why. It says that we have a “continuous” (or numerical variable) on the x-position aesthetic. Boxplots, however, require a categorical variable to be mapped to the x-position aesthetic. We can convert the numerical variable month into a factor categorical variable by using the factor() function. After applying factor(month), month goes from having just the numerical values 1, 2, …, and 12 to having an associated ordering. With this ordering, ggplot() now knows how to work with this variable to produce the plot. ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = factor(month), y = wind_speed)) + geom_boxplot() Figure 21.18: Side-by-side boxplot of wind speed split by month. The resulting Figure 21.18 shows 12 separate “box and whiskers” plots similar to the rightmost plot of Figure 21.16 of only April wind speeds. Thus the different boxplots are shown “side-by-side.” The “box” portions of the visualization represent the 1st quartile, the median (the 2nd quartile), and the 3rd quartile. The height of each box (the value of the 3rd quartile minus the value of the 1st quartile) is the interquartile range (IQR). It is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability. The “whisker” portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and represent points less than the 25th percentile and greater than the 75th percentiles, respectively. They’re set to extend out no more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) units away from either end of the boxes. We say “no more than” because the ends of the whiskers have to correspond to observed wind speeds. The length of these whiskers shows how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability. The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called outliers. These can be thought of as anomalous (“out-of-the-ordinary”) values. It is important to keep in mind that the definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) units long for each boxplot. Looking at this side-by-side plot we can see that the months of February and March have higher median wind speeds as evidenced by the higher solid lines in the middle of the boxes. We can easily compare wind speeds across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the heights of the 12 boxes as quantified by the interquartile ranges are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of wind speeds recorded in a given month. 21.7.2 Summary Side-by-side boxplots provide us with a way to compare the distribution of a numerical variable across multiple values of another variable. One can see where the median falls across the different groups by comparing the solid lines in the center of the boxes. To study the spread of a numerical variable within one of the boxes, look at both the length of the box and also how far the whiskers extend from either end of the box. Outliers are even more easily identified when looking at a boxplot than when looking at a histogram as they are marked with distinct points. 21.8 5NG#5: Barplots Both histograms and boxplots are tools to visualize the distribution of numerical variables. Another commonly desired task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, as we are simply counting different categories within a categorical variable, also known as the levels of the categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts, also known as frequencies, is with barplots (also called barcharts). One complication, however, is how your data is represented. Is the categorical variable of interest “pre-counted” or not? For example, run the following code that manually creates two data frames representing a collection of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. fruits &lt;- tibble(fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)) fruits_counted &lt;- tibble( fruit = c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), number = c(3, 2)) We see both the fruits and fruits_counted data frames represent the same collection of fruit. Whereas fruits just lists the fruit individually… # A tibble: 5 × 1 fruit &lt;chr&gt; 1 apple 2 apple 3 orange 4 apple 5 orange … fruits_counted has a variable count which represent the “pre-counted” values of each fruit. # A tibble: 2 × 2 fruit number &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 apple 3 2 orange 2 Depending on how your categorical data is represented, you’ll need to add a different geometric layer type to your ggplot() to create a barplot, as we now explore. 21.8.1 Barplots via geom_bar or geom_col Let’s generate barplots using these two different representations of the same basket of fruit: 3 apples and 2 oranges. Using the fruits data frame where all 5 fruits are listed individually in 5 rows, we map the fruit variable to the x-position aesthetic and add a geom_bar() layer: ggplot(data = fruits, mapping = aes(x = fruit)) + geom_bar() Figure 21.19: Barplot when counts are not pre-counted. However, using the fruits_counted data frame where the fruits have been “pre-counted,” we once again map the fruit variable to the x-position aesthetic. Here, we also map the count variable to the y-position aesthetic, and add a geom_col() layer instead. ggplot(data = fruits_counted, mapping = aes(x = fruit, y = number)) + geom_col() Figure 21.20: Barplot when counts are pre-counted. Compare the barplots in Figures 21.19 and 21.20. They are identical because they reflect counts of the same five fruits. However, depending on how our categorical data is represented, either “pre-counted” or not, we must add a different geom layer. When the categorical variable whose distribution you want to visualize Is not pre-counted in your data frame, we use geom_bar(). Is pre-counted in your data frame, we use geom_col() with the y-position aesthetic mapped to the variable that has the counts. Let’s now go back to the flights data frame in the nycflights23 package and visualize the distribution of the categorical variable carrier. In other words, let’s visualize the number of domestic flights out of New York City each airline company flew in 2023. Recall from Subsection 6.4.3 when you first explored the flights data frame, you saw that each row corresponds to a flight. In other words, the flights data frame is more like the fruits data frame than the fruits_counted data frame because the flights have not been pre-counted by carrier. Thus we should use geom_bar() instead of geom_col() to create a barplot. Much like a geom_histogram(), there is only one variable in the aes() aesthetic mapping: the variable carrier gets mapped to the x-position. As a difference though, histograms have bars that touch whereas bar graphs have white space between the bars going from left to right. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() Figure 21.21: Number of flights departing NYC in 2023 by airline using geom_bar(). Observe in Figure 21.21 that Republic Airline (YX), United Airlines (UA), and JetBlue Airways (B6) had the most flights depart NYC in 2023. If you don’t know which airlines correspond to which carrier codes, then run View(airlines) to see a directory of airlines. For example, AA is American Airlines Inc. Alternatively, say you had a data frame where the number of flights for each carrier was pre-counted as in Table 21.3. Table 21.3: Number of flights pre-counted for each carrier carrier number 9E 54141 AA 40525 AS 7843 B6 66169 DL 61562 F9 1286 G4 671 HA 366 MQ 357 NK 15189 OO 6432 UA 79641 WN 12385 YX 88785 In order to create a barplot visualizing the distribution of the categorical variable carrier in this case, we would now use geom_col() instead of geom_bar(), with an additional y = number in the aesthetic mapping on top of the x = carrier. The resulting barplot would be identical to Figure 21.21. 21.8.2 Avoid pie charts! One of the most common plots used to visualize the distribution of categorical data is the pie chart. While they may seem harmless enough, pie charts actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well. As Naomi Robbins (2013) describes in her book, Creating More Effective Graphs, we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees. In other words, it is difficult for us to determine the relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another. Let’s examine the same data used in our previous barplot of the number of flights departing NYC by airline in Figure 21.21, but this time we will use a pie chart in Figure 21.22. Try to answer the following questions: How much smaller is the portion of the pie for Hawaiian Airlines Inc. (HA) compared to United Airlines (UA)? What is the third largest carrier in terms of departing flights? How many carriers have fewer flights than Delta Air Lines Inc. (DL)? Figure 21.22: The dreaded pie chart. While it is quite difficult to answer these questions when looking at the pie chart in Figure 21.22, we can much more easily answer these questions using the barchart in Figure 21.21. This is true since barplots present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories can be made with single horizontal lines, whereas pie charts present the information in a way such that comparisons must be made by comparing angles. 21.8.3 Two categorical variables Barplots are a very common way to visualize the frequency of different categories, or levels, of a single categorical variable. Another use of barplots is to visualize the joint distribution of two categorical variables at the same time. Let’s examine the joint distribution of outgoing domestic flights from NYC by carrier as well as origin, in other words, the number of flights for each carrier and origin combination. This corresponds to the number of American Airlines flights from JFK, the number of American Airlines flights from LGA, the number of American Airlines flights from EWR, the number of Endeavor Air flights from JFK, and so on. Recall the ggplot() code that created the barplot of carrier frequency in Figure 21.21: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() We can now map the additional variable origin by adding a fill = origin inside the aes() aesthetic mapping. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) + geom_bar() Figure 21.23: Stacked barplot of flight amount by carrier and origin. Figure 21.23 is an example of a stacked barplot. While simple to make, in certain aspects it is not ideal. For example, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors between the bars, corresponding to comparing the number of flights from each origin airport between the carriers. Before we continue, let’s address some common points of confusion among new R users. First, the fill aesthetic corresponds to the color used to fill the bars, while the color aesthetic corresponds to the color of the outline of the bars. This is identical to how we added color to our histogram in Subsection 21.5.1: we set the outline of the bars to white by setting color = \"white\" and the colors of the bars to blue steel by setting fill = \"steelblue\". Observe in Figure 21.24 that mapping origin to color and not fill yields grey bars with different colored outlines. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, color = origin)) + geom_bar() Figure 21.24: Stacked barplot with color aesthetic used instead of fill. Second, note that fill is another aesthetic mapping much like x-position; thus we were careful to include it within the parentheses of the aes() mapping. The following code, where the fill aesthetic is specified outside the aes() mapping will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new ggplot users make: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier), fill = origin) + geom_bar() An alternative to stacked barplots are side-by-side barplots, also known as dodged barplots, as seen in Figure 21.25. The code to create a side-by-side barplot is identical to the code to create a stacked barplot, but with a position = \"dodge\" argument added to geom_bar(). In other words, we are overriding the default barplot type, which is a stacked barplot, and specifying it to be a side-by-side barplot instead. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = origin)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) Figure 21.25: Side-by-side barplot comparing number of flights by carrier and origin. Lastly, another type of barplot is a faceted barplot. Recall in Section 21.6 we visualized the distribution of hourly wind speeds at the 3 NYC airports split by month using facets. We apply the same principle to our barplot visualizing the frequency of carrier split by origin. Instead of mapping origin to fill we include it as the variable to create small multiples of the plot across the levels of origin in Figure 21.26. ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~ origin, ncol = 1) Figure 21.26: Faceted barplot comparing the number of flights by carrier and origin. 21.8.4 Summary Barplots are a common way of displaying the distribution of a categorical variable, or in other words the frequency with which the different categories (also called levels) occur. They are easy to understand and make it easy to make comparisons across levels. Furthermore, when trying to visualize the relationship of two categorical variables, you have many options: stacked barplots, side-by-side barplots, and faceted barplots. Depending on what aspect of the relationship you are trying to emphasize, you will need to make a choice between these three types of barplots and own that choice. 21.9 Conclusion 21.9.1 Summary table Let’s recap all five of the five named graphs (5NG) in Table 21.4 summarizing their differences. Using these 5NG, you’ll be able to visualize the distributions and relationships of variables contained in a wide array of datasets. This will be even more the case as we start to map more variables to more of each geometric object’s aesthetic attribute options, further unlocking the awesome power of the ggplot2 package. Table 21.4: Summary of Five Named Graphs Named graph Shows Geometric object Notes 1 Scatterplot Relationship between 2 numerical variables geom_point() 2 Linegraph Relationship between 2 numerical variables geom_line() Used when there is a sequential order to x-variable, e.g., time 3 Histogram Distribution of 1 numerical variable geom_histogram() Facetted histograms show the distribution of 1 numerical variable split by the values of another variable 4 Boxplot Distribution of 1 numerical variable split by the values of another variable geom_boxplot() 5 Barplot Distribution of 1 categorical variable geom_bar() when counts are not pre-counted, geom_col() when counts are pre-counted Stacked, side-by-side, and faceted barplots show the joint distribution of 2 categorical variables 21.9.2 Function argument specification Let’s go over some important points about specifying the arguments (i.e., inputs) to functions. Run the following two segments of code: # Segment 1: ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() # Segment 2: ggplot(flights, aes(x = carrier)) + geom_bar() You’ll notice that both code segments create the same barplot, even though in the second segment we omitted the data = and mapping = code argument names. This is because the ggplot() function by default assumes that the data argument comes first and the mapping argument comes second. As long as you specify the data frame in question first and the aes() mapping second, you can omit the explicit statement of the argument names data = and mapping =. Going forward for the rest of this book, all ggplot() code will be like the second segment: with the data = and mapping = explicit naming of the argument omitted with the default ordering of arguments respected. We’ll do this for brevity’s sake; it’s common to see this style when reviewing other R users’ code. 21.9.3 Additional resources If you want to further unlock the power of the ggplot2 package for data visualization, we suggest that you check out RStudio’s “Data Visualization with ggplot2” cheatsheet. This cheatsheet summarizes much more than what we’ve discussed in this chapter. In particular, it presents many more than the 5 geometric objects we covered in this chapter while providing quick and easy to read visual descriptions. For all the geometric objects, it also lists all the possible aesthetic attributes one can tweak. In the current version of RStudio in late 2019, you can access this cheatsheet by going to the RStudio Menu Bar -&gt; Help -&gt; Cheat Sheets -&gt; “Data Visualization with ggplot2.” You can see a preview in the figure below. Alternatively, you can preview the cheat sheet by going to the ggplot2 Github page with this link.

Historically, the concept of race has changed across cultures and eras, and has eventually become less connected with ancestral and familial ties and more concerned with superficial physical characteristics. In the past, theorists developed categories of race based on various geographic regions, ethnicities, skin colors, and more. Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions or skin tones, for example. German physician, zoologist, and anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752-1840) introduced one of the famous groupings by studying human skulls. Blumenbach divided humans into five races (MacCord, 2014): Caucasian or White race: people of European, Middle Eastern, and North African origin Ethiopian or Black race: people of sub-Saharan Africans origin (sometimes spelled Aethiopian) Malayan or Brown race: people of Southeast Asian origin and Pacific Islanders Mongolian or Yellow race: people of all East Asian and some Central Asian origin American or Red race: people of North American origin or American Indians As is probably obvious, this approach to race has fallen into disuse since Blumenbach’s time, and the social construction of race is a more accepted way of understanding racial categories. One compelling example of the social construction of race is how societies have talked about race over time. While many of the historical considerations of race have been corrected in favor of more accurate and sensitive descriptions, some of the older terms remain. For example, it is generally unacceptable and insulting to refer to Asian people or Native American people with color-based terminology, but it is acceptable to refer to White and Black people in that way. To provide a recent example of changing descriptions, a number of publications announced in 2020 that they would begin capitalizing the names of races, though not everyone used the same approach (Seipel 2020). It is also worth noting that some members of racial and ethnic groups “reclaim” terms previously used to insult them (Rao 2018). Social scientists have also widely accepted socially constructed views of race. Organizations including the American Association of Anthropologists, the American Sociological Association, and the American Psychological Association have all officially rejected suggestions that race is biologically identifiable. This position argues that previous racial categories were based on pseudoscience used to justify racist practices (Omi &amp; Winant 1994; Graves 2003). Why bring this up in a course on data science? Well, it turns out that statistics are a powerful tool for both data scientists and pseudoscientists. To embrace statistics responsibly, it’s important that we understand not only how they can be misused in the present but how their very past is tied up with scientific racism—attempts to prove racial superiority or inferiority through scientific techniques. 23.2 The Origins of Statistics Scientific racism is particularly important for us to acknowledge this week, since there are close connections with the idea of statistics. Many of the simplest and most practical methods for summarizing and describing data come to us from four English men born in the 1800s, at the start of the industrial revolution. A considerable amount of the work they did was focused on solving real world problems in manufacturing and agriculture by using data to describe and draw inferences from what they observed. The end of the 1800s and the early 1900s were a time of astonishing progress in mathematics and science. Given enough time, paper, and pencils, scientists and mathematicians of that age imagined that just about any problem facing humankind—including the limitations of people themselves—could be measured, broken down, analyzed, and rebuilt to become more efficient. Four Englishmen who epitomized both this scientific progress and these idealistic beliefs were Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, William Sealy Gosset, and Ronald Fisher. First on the scene was Francis Galton, a half-cousin to the more widely known Charles Darwin, but quite the intellectual force himself. Galton was an English gentleman of independent means who studied Latin, Greek, medicine, and mathematics. Galton made several notable and valuable contributions to mathematics and statistics, in particular illuminating two basic techniques that are widely used today (and that we’ll study later in the semester): correlation and regression. For all his studying and theorizing, Galton was not an outstanding mathematician, but he had a junior partner, Karl Pearson, who is often credited with founding the field of mathematical statistics. Pearson refined the math behind correlation and regression and did a lot else besides to contribute to our modern abilities to manage numbers. Pearson is credited with inspiring some of Einstein’s thoughts about relativity and was an early advocate of women’s rights—though we should also balance that against what we learn about him later. Next to the statistical party was William Sealy Gosset, a wizard at both math and chemistry. It was probably the latter expertise that led the Guinness Brewery in Dublin Ireland to hire Gosset after college. As a forward looking business, the Guinness brewery was on the lookout for ways of making batches of beer more consistent in quality. Gosset stepped in and developed what we now refer to as small sample statistical techniques—ways of generalizing from the results of a relatively few observations. Of course, brewing a batch of beer is a time consuming and expensive process, so in order to draw conclusions from experimental methods applied to just a few batches, Gosset had to figure out the role of chance in determining how a batch of beer had turned out. Gosset developed the t-test, another statistical technique we’ll learn later on. Last but not least among the born-in-the-1800s bunch was Ronald Fisher, another mathematician who also studied the natural sciences, in his case biology and genetics. Unlike Galton, Fisher was not a gentleman of independent means, in fact, during his early married life he and his wife struggled as subsistence farmers. One of Fisher’s professional postings was to an agricultural research farm called Rothhamsted Experimental Station. Here, he had access to data about variations in crop yield that led to his development of an essential statistical technique known as the analysis of variance. Fisher also pioneered the area of experimental design, which includes matters of factors, levels, experimental groups, and control groups that we noted in the previous chapter. Of course, these four are certainly not the only 19th and 20th century mathematicians to have made substantial contributions to practical statistics, but they are notable with respect to the applications of mathematics and statistics to the other sciences. 23.3 The Importance of Statistical Humility One of the critical distinctions woven throughout the work of these four is between the sample of data that you have available to analyze and the larger population of possible cases that may or do exist. When Gosset ran batches of beer at the brewery, he knew that it was impractical to run every possible batch of beer with every possible variation in recipe and preparation. Gosset knew that he had to run a few batches, describe what he had found and then generalize or infer what might happen in future batches. This is a fundamental aspect of working with all types and amounts of data. Over the next three weeks, we’ll be focusing on descriptive statistics. As the name suggests, descriptive statistics are focused on describing a sample of data—that is, the data that we have immediately available to us. However, they cannot tell us anything about all the possible cases that may or do exist (the population). For most statisticians and data scientists, though, the real trick is to infer what the data may mean when generalized to the larger population of data that we don’t have. This is the purpose of inferential statistics, which we haven’t gotten into yet. In Week 11, we’ll explore in greater depth the concepts of samples and populations and spend the rest of the semester working with inferential statistics. This distinction between samples and populations ought to inspire some statistical humility: Whatever data you have, there’s always more out there. There’s data that you might have collected by changing the way things are done or the way things are measured. There’s future data that hasn’t been collected yet and might never be collected. There’s even data that we might have gotten using the exact same strategies we did use, but that would have come out subtly different just due to randomness. Whatever data you have, it is just a snapshot or “sample” of what might be out there. This leads us to the conclusion that we can never, ever 100% trust the data we have. We must always hold back and keep in mind that there is always uncertainty in data. A lot of the power and goodness in statistics comes from the capabilities that people like Fisher developed to help us characterize and quantify that uncertainty and for us to know when to guard against putting too much stock in what a sample of data have to say. 23.4 Eugenics: A Failure of Statistical Humility Many of the critiques of data science that I have made (or repeated) in this textbook come down to a failure to embrace this kind of statistical humility. In my opinion, most of the greatest wrongs that have been done by data scientists (and that will yet be done by data scientists) come from putting too much trust in data and failing to recognize the inherent uncertainty in data. Indeed despite all of early statisticians’ commitments to making distinctions between samples and populations, they were wildly—and recklessly—overconfident about what they could learn from statistics and science. In short, the wrongs done by data scientists have clear ancestors in the realm of statistics more broadly. Let’s consider eugenics: the idea that the human race could be improved through selective breeding. Many of the men often cited as the earliest statistical luminaries—including those we learned about above—were also leaders in the eugenics movement (Spade &amp; Rohlfs, 2016). In fact, Francis Galton is probably better known as a proponent of eugenics (and perhaps as coining the term) than he is as a statistical pioneer. Galton studied heredity in peas, rabbits, and people and concluded that certain people should be paid to get married and have children because their offspring would improve the human race. Galton’s collaborator Karl Pearson held the first eugenics chair at the University of London, where he developed many of the statistical concepts and methods still in use today. Ronald Fisher also embraced eugenic ideas. There are consequences to the co-development of statistical techniques and the eugenics movement. In her book Ghost Stories for Darwin: The Science of Variation and the Politics of Diversity, postcolonial science studies scholar Banu Subramaniam (2014) details how over the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as statistics became the preferred language of communication between biologists and social scientists, certain ideas from the eugenics movement also carried over into this broader scientific conversation. While the most odious aspects of these ideas have been largely (and thankfully) stripped away, certain core principles—like a generalized belief in the benefit of control and cleanliness—remain. We’ve run into this generalized belief before, when we were discussing the role of data cleaning in data science, but it’s only now that we’re making a connection with eugenics. To be clear: the point here is not that anyone who cleans their data is perpetuating eugenics (though Chun [2018] has provided a detailed critique suggesting that certain statistical techniques are inherently racist). The point, rather, is that the ideas underlying the belief that data should always be clean and controlled have tainted historical roots. As data scientists, we cannot forget these roots, even as the ideas themselves have been tidied up over time. 23.5 The Continuing Legacy of Eugenics and Scientific Racism Eugenics is a troubling idea: It’s a view that humans should control the evolution of their species by encouraging the reproduction of “superior” kinds of people (namely, White ones) and discouraging the reproduction of all others (where “discouraging” has taken the form the form of forced sterilization and, in its worst instantiations, murder and death). Eugenic ideas were most notably embraced by the Nazis as a justification for killing people because they belonged to supposedly inferior races. We should feel tremendous relief that the worst of eugenics are firmly in the past. However, scholars point out—rightly—that certain eugenic assumptions have never gone away. There is a long history of the United States employing sterilization programs in prisons, for example (see Perry, 2017). Likewise, scientific racism continues to live on in some circles. The idea that “biological race” influenced intelligence was mostly put to rest in the later 20th century, but it has resurged several times in the past 50 years, including the widely read and cited 1994 book, The Bell Curve. I can say from experience as a social media researcher that in certain extreme spaces of the internet, it is taken as scientific fact that White people are inherently more intelligent than people of other races. Eugenics and scientific racism are not behind us, and statistics continue to be used to defend them. How, then, should we respond to the use of statistics to bolster racist ideas? Let’s examine the racist idea that some races are inherently more intelligent than others to consider some possible responses. Some researchers would prefer to fight statistical fire with statistical fire: For example, researchers have provided substantial evidence that refutes a biological-racial basis for intelligence, including the widespread closing of IQ gaps as Black people gained more access to education (Dickens, 2006). This approach has considerable appeal to it: Let’s use good applications of statistics (bolstered by appropriate use of theory) to challenge bad applications of statistics (which advance racist theory). However, for some folks, this doesn’t go far enough. IQ tests as we know them owe their development in part to eugenicists, including Stanford professor Lewis Terman, who was confident that the test would “prove” racial differences of intelligence (see Kendi, 2016). In fact, the very logic of the IQ test (that intelligence is an innate characteristic of individuals and that society benefits from knowing who has higher or lower intelligence) has dangerous overlap with eugenic assumptions (that some individuals are innately “better” than others and that society benefits from knowing which individuals are “better” or “worse”). So, it’s good news that racial IQ gaps close with schooling, but the very fact that schooling affects IQ challenges the entire premise of the concept in the first place—and if IQ tests were built on eugenics-friendly concepts in the first place, can we even trust the statistics that come from them? This gets even more complicated when we consider that the IQ test is the ancestor of the modernized standardized test: Au (2016) has argued that although high-stakes testing in U.S. schools are intended to be anti-racist, the entire project of measuring learning through statistics derived from standardized tests is built on assumptions that exacerbate structural racism. This is a complex example, which makes it a good one to end on. There’s no denying that quantitative data and statistical analyses are helpful for learning more about education—but we must, must, must not let the natural allure of the power of statistics make us overconfident or lead us down racist paths. 23.6 Conclusion Data science owes a lot to statistical pioneers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, data scientists cannot afford to forget that those statistical pioneers were often gung-ho proponents of scientific racism. As we buid on their work today, we must embrace statistical humility and be committed to checking our own assumptions about the world. Statistics can go a long way toward fighting against scientific racism, but our commitment to fight against racism of all flavors must also shape how we think about and employ statistics. 23.7 References Chun, W.

Indeed, we’ll be returning the the dplyr package (though, you’ll see below that we’ll load it as part of tidyverse) and to some of its wrangling functions as a way of getting some experience with descriptive statistics. Needed packages Let’s load all the packages needed for our wrangling practice (this assumes you’ve already installed them). If needed, read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(nycflights23) 24.2 summarize variables One common task when working with data frames is to compute summary statistics. Summary statistics are single numerical values that summarize a large number of values. As such, they are among the most common descriptive statistics that we work with; if I ask you something about “descriptive statistics” in a class project, I’m generally asking you about summary statistics. Commonly known examples of summary statistics include the mean (also called the average) and the median (the middle value). Other examples of summary statistics that might not immediately come to mind include the sum, the smallest value also called the minimum, the largest value also called the maximum, and the standard deviation. In fact, the boxplots we worked with in Section 21.7 are a visual summary of some key descriptive statistics, and you may want to revisit that walkthrough after completing this one. Let’s calculate two summary statistics of the wind_speed variable in the weather data frame (recall from Section 6.4 that the weather data frame is included in the nycflights23 package). In particular, we’ll calculate the mean and standard deviation. 24.2.1 Mean The mean is the most commonly reported measure of center. It is commonly called the average, though this term can be a little ambiguous. The mean is the sum of all of the data elements divided by how many elements there are. If we have \\(n\\) data points, the mean is given by: \\[Mean = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n}\\] 24.2.2 Standard Deviation An important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are concentrated closely near the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation. The standard deviation is a number that measures how far data values are from their mean. The standard deviation: provides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set, and can be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean. 24.2.2.1 Measure of Overall Variation The standard deviation is always positive or zero. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard deviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. Suppose that we are studying the amount of time customers wait in line at the checkout at supermarket A and supermarket B. the average wait time at both supermarkets is five minutes. At supermarket A, the standard deviation for the wait time is two minutes; at supermarket B the standard deviation for the wait time is four minutes. Because supermarket B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more variation in the wait times at supermarket B. Overall, wait times at supermarket B are more spread out from the average; wait times at supermarket A are more concentrated near the average. 24.2.2.2 Determining Whether a Data Value is Close To or Far From the Mean Suppose that Rosa and Binh both shop at supermarket A. Rosa waits at the checkout counter for seven minutes and Binh waits for one minute. At supermarket A, the mean waiting time is five minutes and the standard deviation is two minutes. The standard deviation can be used to determine whether a data value is close to or far from the mean. Rosa waits for seven minutes: Seven is two minutes longer than the average of five; two minutes is equal to one standard deviation. Rosa’s wait time of seven minutes is two minutes longer than the average of five minutes. Rosa’s wait time of seven minutes is one standard deviation above the average of five minutes. Binh waits for one minute. One is four minutes less than the average of five; four minutes is equal to two standard deviations. Binh’s wait time of one minute is four minutes less than the average of five minutes. Binh’s wait time of one minute is two standard deviations below the average of five minutes. As we’ll discuss later on in the semester, a data value that is two standard deviations from the average is just on the borderline for what many data scientists would consider to be far from the average. Considering data to be far from the mean if it is more than two standard deviations away is more of an approximate “rule of thumb” than a rigid rule. 24.2.2.3 Calculating the Standard Deviation If x is a number, then the difference “x – mean” is called its deviation. In a data set, there are as many deviations as there are items in the data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. The procedure to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the numbers are the entire population or are data from a sample. The calculations are similar, but not identical. To calculate the standard deviation, we need to calculate the variance first. The variance is the average of the squares of the deviations (the x – mean values). You can think of the standard deviation as a special average of the deviations. If the numbers come from a census of the entire population and not a sample, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations to find the variance, we divide by N, the number of items in the population. If the data are from a sample rather than a population, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations, we divide by n – 1, one less than the number of items in the sample. The formula can be a little intimidating at first but it is important to remember that it is essentially a measure of how far we expect a given data value will be from its mean: \\[sd = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}}\\] The variance of a variable is merely the standard deviation squared. \\[variance = sd^2 = \\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}\\] Of course, while understanding how mean and standard deviation are calculated is important, one of the advantages of using software like R is that it will do the calculations for us! 24.2.3 Calculating Mean with mean() and Standard Deviation with sd() To compute these summary statistics, we need the mean() and sd() summary functions in R. Summary functions in R take in many values and return a single value, as illustrated in Figure 24.1. Figure 24.1: Diagram illustrating summary() function in R. More precisely, we’ll use the mean() and sd() summary functions within the summarize() function from the dplyr package. Note you can also use the British English spelling of summarise(). As shown in Figure 24.2, the summarize() function takes in a data frame and returns a data frame with only one row corresponding to the summary statistics. Figure 24.2: Diagram of summarize() rows. We’ll save the results in a new data frame called summary_windspeed that will have two columns/variables: the mean and the std_dev: summary_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed), std_dev = sd(wind_speed)) summary_windspeed # A tibble: 1 × 2 mean std_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 NA NA Why are the values returned NA? NA is how R encodes missing values where NA indicates “not available” or “not applicable.” If a value for a particular row and a particular column does not exist, NA is stored instead. Values can be missing for many reasons. Perhaps the data was collected but someone forgot to enter it. Perhaps the data was not collected at all because it was too difficult to do so. Perhaps there was an erroneous value that someone entered that has been corrected to read as missing. You’ll often encounter issues with missing values when working with real data. Going back to our summary_windspeed output, by default any time you try to calculate a summary statistic of a variable that has one or more NA missing values in R, NA is returned. To work around this fact, you can set the na.rm argument to TRUE, where rm is short for “remove”; this will ignore any NA missing values and only return the summary value for all non-missing values. The code that follows computes the mean and standard deviation of all non-missing values of temp: summary_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_windspeed # A tibble: 1 × 2 mean std_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 9.43405 5.26836 Notice how the na.rm = TRUE are used as arguments to the mean() and sd() summary functions individually, and not to the summarize() function. However, one needs to be cautious whenever ignoring missing values as we’ve just done. There are consequences to blindly sweeping rows with missing values “under the rug.” This is why the na.rm argument to any summary statistic function in R is set to FALSE by default. In other words, R does not ignore rows with missing values by default. R is alerting you to the presence of missing data and you should be mindful of this missingness and any potential causes of this missingness throughout your analysis. What are other summary functions we can use inside the summarize() verb to compute summary statistics? As seen in the diagram in Figure 24.1, you can use any function in R that takes many values and returns just one. Here are just a few: mean(): the average sd(): the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread min() and max(): the minimum and maximum values, respectively sum(): the total amount when adding multiple numbers n(): a count of the number of rows in each group. This particular summary function will make more sense when group_by() is covered in Section 24.3. We can also use IQR() to return the interquartile range with summarize(). We touched on percentiles, quartiles, and interquartile range when we recently looked at boxplots, but it’s worth taking a closer look at them now. 24.2.4 Percentiles, Quartiles and IQR() Quartiles and percentiles are both measures of location—they indicate where a particular data point falls within the whole dataset. Quartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile, Q3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th percentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. To score in the 90th percentile of an exam does not mean, necessarily, that you received 90% on a test. It means that 90% of test scores are the same or less than your score and 10% of the test scores are the same or greater than your test score. Percentiles are useful for comparing values. For this reason, universities and colleges use percentiles extensively. One instance in which colleges and universities use percentiles is when SAT results are used to determine a minimum testing score that will be used as an acceptance factor. For example, suppose Duke accepts SAT scores at or above the 75th percentile. That translates into a score of at least 1220. Percentiles are mostly used with very large populations. Therefore, if you were to say that 90% of the test scores are less (and not the same or less) than your score, it would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is not significant. The median is a number that measures the “center” of the data. You can think of the median as the “middle value,” but it does not actually have to be one of the observed values. It is a number that separates ordered data into halves. Half the values are the same number or smaller than the median, and half the values are the same number or larger. For example, consider the following data. 1; 11.5; 6; 7.2; 4; 8; 9; 10; 6.8; 8.3; 2; 2; 10; 1 Here they are again, ordered from smallest to largest: 1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8; 7.2; 8; 8.3; 9; 10; 10; 11.5 Since there are 14 observations, the median is between the seventh value, 6.8, and the eighth value, 7.2. To find the median, add the two values together and divide by two. In this case, we add 6.8 and 7.2 to get 14; 14 divided by 2 is 7. So, our median is seven. Half of the values are smaller than seven and half of the values are larger than seven. Quartiles are numbers that separate the data into quarters. Like the median, quartiles may or may not be part of the data. To find the quartiles, first find the median (or second quartile). The first quartile, Q1, is the middle value of the lower half of the data, and the third quartile, Q3, is the middle value, or median, of the upper half of the data. The interquartile range is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half or the middle 50% of the data. It is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). IQR = Q3 – Q1 The IQR can help to determine potential outliers. A value is suspected to be a potential outlier if it is less than (1.5)(IQR) below the first quartile or more than (1.5)(IQR) above the third quartile. Potential outliers always require further investigation. 24.3 group_by rows Figure 24.3: Diagram of group_by() and summarize(). Let’s imagine that instead of a single mean wind speed for the whole year, we would like 12 mean temperatures, one for each of the 12 months separately. In other words, we would like to compute the mean wind speed split by month as shown via generic diagram in Figure 24.3. We can do this by “grouping” temperature observations by the values of another variable, in this case by the 12 values of the variable month: summary_monthly_windspeed &lt;- weather |&gt; group_by(month) |&gt; summarize(mean = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), std_dev = sd(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE)) summary_monthly_windspeed # A tibble: 12 × 3 month mean std_dev &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 10.3198 6.00550 2 2 10.8724 6.59719 3 3 12.3510 6.35710 4 4 10.0135 5.01567 5 5 8.88232 4.44858 6 6 8.52267 4.42009 7 7 7.95770 4.35501 8 8 8.82896 4.34232 9 9 8.92012 4.65816 10 10 8.21426 4.71273 11 11 9.48388 4.81262 12 12 8.76809 5.03388 This code is identical to the previous code that created summary_windspeed, but with an extra group_by(month) added before the summarize(). Grouping the weather dataset by month and then applying the summarize() functions yields a data frame that displays the mean and standard deviation wind speed split by the 12 months of the year. It is important to note that the group_by() function doesn’t change data frames by itself. Rather it changes the meta-data, or data about the data, specifically the grouping structure. Only after applying the summarize() function does the data frame change.

Let’s now revisit the n() counting summary function we briefly introduced previously. Recall that the n() function counts rows. This is opposed to the sum() summary function that returns the sum of a numerical variable. For example, suppose we’d like to count how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City: by_origin &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(origin) |&gt; summarize(count = n()) by_origin # A tibble: 3 × 2 origin count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 EWR 138578 2 JFK 133048 3 LGA 163726 We see that LaGuardia (\"LGA\") had the most flights departing in 2023 followed by Newark (\"EWR\") and lastly by \"JFK\". Note there is a subtle but important difference between sum() and n(); while sum() returns the sum of a numerical variable, n() returns a count of the number of rows/observations. Grouping by more than one variable You are not limited to grouping by one variable. Say you want to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports for each month. We can also group by a second variable month using group_by(origin, month): by_origin_monthly &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(origin, month) |&gt; summarize(count = n()) Note that an additional message appears here specifying the grouping done. The .groups argument to summarize() has four options: drop_last, drop, keep, and rowwise: drop_last drops the last grouping variable, drop drops all grouping variables, keep keeps all grouping variables, and rowwise turns each row into a group. In most circumstances, the default is drop_last which drops the last grouping variable. The message is informing us that the default behavior is to drop the last grouping variable, which in this case is month. by_origin_monthly # A tibble: 36 × 3 # Groups: origin [3] origin month count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 EWR 1 11623 2 EWR 2 10991 3 EWR 3 12593 4 EWR 4 12022 5 EWR 5 12371 6 EWR 6 11339 7 EWR 7 11646 8 EWR 8 11561 9 EWR 9 11373 10 EWR 10 11805 # ℹ 26 more rows Observe that there are 36 rows to by_origin_monthly because there are 12 months for 3 airports (EWR, JFK, and LGA). Why do we group_by(origin, month) and not group_by(origin) and then group_by(month)? Let’s investigate: by_origin_monthly_incorrect &lt;- flights |&gt; group_by(origin) |&gt; group_by(month) |&gt; summarize(count = n()) by_origin_monthly_incorrect # A tibble: 12 × 2 month count &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 36020 2 2 34761 3 3 39514 4 4 37476 5 5 38710 6 6 35921 7 7 36211 8 8 36765 9 9 35505 10 10 36586 11 11 34521 12 12 33362 What happened here is that the second group_by(month) overwrote the grouping structure meta-data of the earlier group_by(origin), so that in the end we are only grouping by month. The lesson here is if you want to group_by() two or more variables, you should include all the variables at the same time in the same group_by() adding a comma between the variable names. 24.4 Conclusion When I first learned about grouping and summarizing variables in R, it seemed like a lot of work for benefits that weren’t always clear. The more time I spend with these concepts, though, the easier they get, and the more valuable they become. These days, in fact, grouping and summarizing are one of the first things I do whenever I get a new dataset to work with. Descriptive statistics can be a great way to get a quick feel for your data, and these functions are helpful for calculating them!

For example, is there a relationship between the grade on the second data science exam a student takes and the grade on the final exam? If there is a relationship, what is the relationship and how strong is it? In another example, your income may be influenced by your education, your profession, your years of experience, and your ability. The amount you pay a repair person for labor is often determined by an initial amount plus an hourly fee. The type of data described in these examples is bivariate data—“bi” for two variables. In reality, data scientists tend to use multivariate data, meaning many variables. In this reading, you will be studying the simplest form of regression, “linear regression” with one explanatory variable (x). This involves data that fits a line in two dimensions. You will also study correlation, which measures how strong the relationship is. 26.2 Linear Equations Linear regression for two variables is based on a linear equation with one explanatory variable. The equation has the form \\(y = a + bx\\) The graph of a linear equation of the form \\(y = a + bx\\) is a straight line. Any line that is not vertical can be described by this equation. If all of this reminds you of algebra, it should! That said, in statistics, we assign specific meanings to these different terms that you might not have covered in algebra. For example, the variable \\(x\\) is the explanatory (or independent or predictable) variable, and \\(y\\) is the outcome (or dependent) variable. This was just as true in algebra as it is in this class, but that isn’t always specified in algebra—by contrast, it’s very important to understand that for data science. Similarly, in algebra, you may have referred to \\(a\\) as the \\(y\\)-intercept and \\(b\\) as the slope. These both make sense: \\(a\\) is the value at which the line crosses (intercepts) the \\(y\\)-axis, and \\(b\\) describes how steep the line is. In a statistical analysis, however, those mean specific things, which are key to our interpretation of a regression analysis. Let’s talk about \\(a\\) first, which you may see described as just the “intercept” or even as a “constant.” In short, it’s the value of the outcome variable when the explanatory variable is at 0. Sometimes, this can be really helpful! For example, if the outcome variable is a measure of sickness, and the explanatory variable is a dosage of medicine, the intercept gives us an estimate for how sick someone would be without any medicine at all (these are sloppy examples, of course—they get the point across, but we’d need a lot more detail to really interpret that relationship). Other times, though, the intercept is a bit nonsensical. If we wanted to measure the relationship between height and weight, we could set height as our explanatory variable and weight as our outcome variable. R will dutifully spit out an intercept value for us, which would represent the weight we would expect for someone with a height of 0; since that’s impossible, that number is actually pretty useless. Even more important is how we think of \\(b\\); after all, the slope of the line is really just a visual representation of something in our data. In data science, we refer to \\(b\\) as a coefficient, and it represents the strength of the relationship between the explanatory and outcome variables. In very specific terms, \\(b\\) represents the change in the outcome variable for a 1-unit increase of the explanatory variable. A positive coefficient suggest a positive relationship (demonstrated in a plot by a positive slope): More of the explanatory variable leads to more of the outcome variable. A negative coefficient suggests a negative relationship (demonstrated in a plot by a negative slope): More of the explanatory variable leads to less of the outcome variable. 26.3 Linear Relationships and Scatterplots We’ve already touched on scatterplots as a visualization technique for examining the relationship between two variables. The connection between a linear relationship and a scatterplot visualization is pretty intuitive. For example, a scatterplot shows the direction of a relationship between the variables. A clear direction happens when there is either: High values of one variable occurring with high values of the other variable or low values of one variable occurring with low values of the other variable. High values of one variable occurring with low values of the other variable. You can determine the strength of the relationship by looking at the scatterplot and seeing how close the points are to a line—the kind that we might express with the equation above. However, not all lines are created equal! In particular, consider a scatter plot where all the points fall on a horizontal line providing a “perfect fit.” This is actually evidence of no relationship. This makes sense if you consider that the slope of such a line is 0, which means that the coefficient is 0 and, therefore, that the explanatory variable has no effect on the outcome variable. When you look at a scatterplot, you want to notice the overall pattern and any deviations from the pattern. In this chapter, we are interested in scatter plots that show a linear pattern. Linear patterns are quite common. The linear relationship is strong if the points are close to a straight line, except in the case of a horizontal line, which indicates there is no relationship. However, the connection between the scatterplot visualization and a linear relationship actually goes deeper than just the intuitive connection between them. Linear regression uses geometric distances between points on a two-dimensional plane to calculate the equation that best defines the relationship between these variables. 26.4 The Regression Equation Data rarely fit a straight line exactly—this is one of the reasons that we need to be humble about our data science work! Usually, you must be satisfied with rough predictions. Typically, you have a set of data whose scatter plot appears to “fit” a straight line. This is called a Line of Best Fit or Least-Squares Line. Imagine that a random sample of 11 data science students produced the following data, where \\(x\\) is the third exam score out of 80, and \\(y\\) is the final exam score out of 200. Can you predict the final exam score of a random student if you know the third exam score? The third exam score, \\(x\\), is the explanatory variable and the final exam score, \\(y\\), is the outcome variable. Let’s consider a scatterplot that visually represents this hypothetical dataset: We could use a line that represents a linear equation to describe the relationship between these variables. Just eyeballing it, most of you would probably come up with a line with a positive slope, which suggests a positive relationship between these variables. That’s not surprising at all. However, even if everyone were careful, each of you would draw different lines. To come up with an consistent best fit line, we can use what is called a least-squares regression line. Consider the following diagram. Each point of data is of the the form (\\(x\\), \\(y\\)) and each point of the line of best fit using least-squares linear regression has the form (x, ŷ). The \\(ŷ\\) is read “y hat” and is the estimated value of y. It is the value of \\(y\\) obtained using the regression line. It is not generally equal to \\(y\\) from data. The term \\(y_{0} – ŷ_{0} = ε_{0}\\) is called the “error” or residual. It is not an error in the sense of a mistake. The absolute value of a residual measures the vertical distance between the actual value of \\(y\\) and the estimated value of \\(y\\). In other words, it measures the vertical distance between the actual data point and the predicted point on the line. If the observed data point lies above the line, the residual is positive, and the line underestimates the actual data value for \\(y\\). If the observed data point lies below the line, the residual is negative, and the line overestimates that actual data value for \\(y\\). You can calculate the residuals (or errors) for each data point. Then, if you square them (so that negative residuals don’t cancel out positive residuals) and add them together, you get a Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), a measure of the amount of error for particular points and a particular line. Using calculus, you can determine the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that make the SSE a minimum. When you make the SSE a minimum, you have determined the points that are on the line of best fit—that is, you’ve found the line for which there’s the least amount of error. 26.5 Least Squares Criteria for Best Fit The process of fitting the best-fit line is called linear regression. The idea behind finding the best-fit line is based on the assumption that the data are scattered about a straight line. The criteria for the best fit line is that the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized, that is, made as small as possible. Any other line you might choose would have a higher SSE than the best fit line. This best fit line is called the least-squares regression line. The graph of the line of best fit for the third-exam/final-exam example is as follows: The least squares regression line (best-fit line) for the third-exam/final-exam example has the equation: \\(y = -173.51 + 4.83 x\\) Looping back to our discussion of linear equations, we can interpret this! Let’s start with the overall interpretation and then break it down. Our regression model estimates that a student’s final exam score (out of \\(200\\)) ought to equal \\(-173.51\\) plus \\(4.83\\) for every point (out of 80) they scored on the third exam for the class. Our intercept here is kind of useless. It predicts that a student who scored a 0 on the third exam will score a \\(-173.51/200\\) on the final exam, and I can promise that professors are (usually) not so cruel as to give negative points for final exams. This number makes sense mathematically but not conceptually. However, our coefficient here is really helpful: For every additional point that a student scores on the third exam, we can expect them to score an additional 4.83 points on the final exam. That’s not a perfect prediction (linear regression never is), but it’s helpful to know. 26.6 Correlation Coefficients Besides looking at the scatter plot and seeing that a line seems reasonable, how can you tell if the line is a good predictor? We can calculate a correlation coefficient as another indicator (besides the scatterplot) of the strength of the relationship between x and y. Before moving on, a few words about correlations. First, even though data scientists generally have the goal of establishing causal relationships between variables, doing so is actually quite difficult. A common saying in statistics and data science is that correlation isn’t causation. Two variables may be correlated without having any kind of causal relationship between them. Second, in popular language, “correlation” is used to indicate any kind of relationship between two phenomena. However, in statistics and data science, correlation refers specifically to the kind of relationship suggested by a correlation analysis. If you’re reporting on the results of a regression, for example, it would be inappropriate to talk about variables being correlated, because that’s not the kind of analysis that you’re doing. The correlation coefficient, \\(r\\), developed by Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is numerical and provides a measure of strength and direction of the linear association between the explanatory variable \\(x\\) and the outcome variable \\(y\\). For the moment, we’re not going to worry about how the correlation coefficient is calculated. However, If you suspect a linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), then \\(r\\) can measure how strong the linear relationship is. What the VALUE of \\(r\\) tells us: The value of \\(r\\) is always between \\(–1\\) and \\(+1\\): \\(–1 ≤ r ≤ 1\\). The size of the correlation \\(r\\) indicates the strength of the linear relationship between x and y. Values of \\(r\\) close to –1 or to +1 indicate a stronger linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If \\(r = 0\\) there is likely no linear correlation. It is important to view the scatterplot, however, because data that exhibit a curved or horizontal pattern may have a correlation of \\(0\\). If \\(r = 1\\), there is perfect positive correlation. If \\(r = –1\\), there is perfect negative correlation. In both these cases, all of the original data points lie on a straight line. Of course,in the real world, this will not generally happen. What the SIGN of r tells us: A positive value of \\(r\\) means that when \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) tends to increase and when \\(x\\) decreases, \\(y\\) tends to decrease (positive correlation). A negative value of \\(r\\) means that when \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) tends to decrease and when \\(x\\) decreases, \\(y\\) tends to increase (negative correlation). The sign of \\(r\\) is the same as the sign of the slope, \\(b\\), of the best-fit line. In addition to the correlation coefficient itself, we can consider the variable \\(r^2\\). This is called the coefficient of determination and is the square of the correlation coefficient. However, it is usually stated as a percent, rather than in decimal form. \\(r^2\\) is always calculated as part of a regression analysis because it tells us some things about the data: When \\(r^2\\) is expressed as a percent, it represents the percent of variation in the dependent (predicted) variable y that can be explained by variation in the independent (explanatory) variable x using the regression (best-fit) line. When \\(1 - r^2\\) is expressed as a percentage, it represents the percent of variation in \\(y\\) that is NOT explained by variation in \\(x\\) using the regression line. This can be seen as the scattering of the observed data points about the regression line. So, for example, the \\(r^2\\) value for our third exam/final exam regression from earlier is \\(0.4397\\). This tells us that approximately 44% (\\(0.4397\\) is approximately \\(0.44\\), which is equivalent to 44%) of the variation in the final-exam grades can be explained by the variations in the grade on the third exam. However, there is still approximately 56% of the variation in final exam grades (\\(1 - 0.44 = 0.56\\), which is equivalent to 56%) that isn’t explained by our model. Over half of the variation between students’ final exam scores can be attributed to factors other than their performance on the third exam. 26.7 Conclusion Regression and correlation are the main kinds of statistical analysis that we’ll be doing this semester, so it’s important that we get the mechanics down. If reading over all of this felt like a lot, we’re actually going to cover it all again with our application activity; the concepts that we covered in this understanding reading are important, but as with most things data science, I strongly feel that actually doing something helps more than reading it. Besides, the application take on all of this will tackle it from a different angle, so a couple of different perspectives ought to be helpful in helping these ideas really sink in.

As I stated at the end of this week’s understanding reading, this walkthrough is going to repeat much of what we read there, though this focus on modeling—and practical application of data science—will give us a new way of thinking about it. In this chapter, we work with regression, a method that helps us study the relationship between an outcome variable or response and one or more explanatory variables or regressors. The method starts by proposing a statistical model. Data is then collected and used to estimate the coefficients or parameters for the model, and these results are typically used for two purposes: For explanation when we want to describe how changes in one or more of the regressors are associated with changes in the response, quantify those changes, establish which of the regressors truly have an association with the response, or determine whether the model used to describe the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables seems appropriate. For prediction when we want to determine, based on the observed values of the regressors, what will the value of the response be? We are not concerned about how all the regressors relate and interact with one another or with the response, we simply want as good predictions as possible. As an illustration, assume that we want to study the relationship between blood pressure and potential risk factors such as daily salt intake, age, and physical activity levels. The response is blood pressure, and the regressors are the risk factors. If we use linear regression for explanation, we may want to determine whether reducing daily salt intake has a real effect on lowering blood pressure, or by how much blood pressure decreases if an individual reduces their salt intake by half. This information may help target individuals of a specific age group with advice on dietary changes to manage blood pressure. On the other hand, if we use linear regression for prediction, we would like to determine, as accurately as possible, the blood pressure of a given individual based on the data collected about their salt intake, age, and physical activity levels. In this chapter, we will use linear regression for explanation. The most basic and commonly-used type of regression is linear regression. Linear regression involves a numerical response and one or more regressors that can be numerical or categorical. It is called linear regression because the statistical model that describes the relationship between the expected response and the regressors is assumed to be linear. In particular, when the model has a single regressor, the linear regression is the equation of a line. Linear regression is the foundation for almost any other type of regression or related method. We begin with regression with a single explanatory variable. We also introduce the correlation coefficient, discuss “correlation versus causation,” and determine whether the model fits the data observed. Needed packages load all the packages needed for this chapter (this assumes you’ve already installed them). In this chapter, we introduce some new packages: The tidyverse “umbrella” package. Recall from our discussion in Section 18.4 that loading the tidyverse package by running library(tidyverse) loads the following commonly used data science packages all at once: ggplot2 for data visualization dplyr for data wrangling tidyr for converting data to “tidy” format readr for importing spreadsheet data into R As well as the more advanced purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats packages The moderndive package of datasets and functions for tidyverse-friendly introductory linear regression as well as a data frame summary function.

Why do some countries exhibit high fertility rates while others have significantly lower ones? Are there correlations between fertility rates and life expectancy across different continents and nations? Could underlying socioeconomic factors be influencing these trends? These are all questions that are of interest to demographers and policy makers, as understanding fertility rates is important for planning and development. By analyzing the dataset of UN member states, which includes variables such as country codes (ISO), fertility rates, and life expectancy for 2022, researchers can uncover patterns and make predictions about fertility rates based on life expectancy. In this section, we aim to explain differences in fertility rates as a function of one numerical variable: life expectancy. Could it be that countries with higher life expectancy also have lower fertility rates? Could it be instead that countries with higher life expectancy tend to have higher fertility rates? Or could it be that there is no relationship between life expectancy and fertility rates? We answer these questions by modeling the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy using simple linear regression where we have: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) (the country’s fertility rate) and A single numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\) (the country’s life expectancy). 27.2.1 Exploratory data analysis The data on the 193 current UN member states (as of 2024) can be found in the un_member_states_2024 data frame included in the moderndive package. However, to keep things simple we include only those rows that don’t have missing data with na.omit() and select() only the subset of the variables we’ll consider in this chapter, and save this data in a new data frame called UN_data_m9: UN_data_m9 &lt;- un_member_states_2024 |&gt; select(iso, life_exp = life_expectancy_2022, fert_rate = fertility_rate_2022, obes_rate = obesity_rate_2016)|&gt; na.omit() A crucial step before doing any kind of analysis or modeling is performing an exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short. EDA gives you a sense of the distributions of the individual variables in your data, whether any potential relationships exist between variables, whether there are outliers and/or missing values, and (most importantly) how to build your model. Here are three common steps in an EDA: Most crucially, looking at the raw data values. Computing summary statistics, such as means, medians, and maximums. Creating data visualizations. We perform the first common step in an exploratory data analysis: looking at the raw data values. Because this step seems so trivial, unfortunately many data analysts ignore it. However, getting an early sense of what your raw data looks like can often prevent many larger issues down the road. You can do this by using RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using the glimpse() function as introduced in Subsection 6.4.3 on exploring data frames: glimpse(UN_data_m9) Rows: 181 Columns: 4 $ iso &lt;chr&gt; &quot;AFG&quot;, &quot;ALB&quot;, &quot;DZA&quot;, &quot;AGO&quot;, &quot;ATG&quot;, &quot;ARG&quot;, &quot;ARM&quot;, &quot;AUS&quot;, &quot;AUT… $ life_exp &lt;dbl&gt; 53.6, 79.5, 78.0, 62.1, 77.8, 78.3, 76.1, 83.1, 82.3, 74.2, … $ fert_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 4.3, 1.4, 2.7, 5.0, 1.6, 1.9, 1.6, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.8, … $ obes_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 5.5, 21.7, 27.4, 8.2, 18.9, 28.3, 20.2, 29.0, 20.1, 19.9, 31… Observe that Rows: 181 indicates that there are 181 rows/observations in UN_data_m9 after filtering out the missing values, where each row corresponds to one observed country/member state. It is important to note that the observational unit is an individual country. Recall from Subsection 6.4.3 that the observational unit is the “type of thing” that is being measured by our variables. A full description of all the variables included in un_member_states_2024 can be found by reading the associated help file (run ?un_member_states_2024 in the console). Let’s describe only the 4 variables we selected in UN_data_m9: iso: An identification variable used to distinguish between the 181 countries in the filtered dataset. fert_rate: A numerical variable representing the country’s fertility rate in 2022 corresponding to the expected number of children born per woman in child-bearing years. This is the outcome variable \\(y\\) of interest. life_exp: A numerical variable representing the country’s average life expectancy in 2022 in years. This is the primary explanatory variable \\(x\\) of interest. obes_rate: A numerical variable representing the country’s obesity rate in 2016. This will be another explanatory variable \\(x\\) that we use in the Learning check at the end of this subsection. An alternative way to look at the raw data values is by choosing a random sample of the rows in UN_data_m9 by piping it into the slice_sample() function from the dplyr package. Here we set the n argument to be 5, indicating that we want a random sample of 5 rows. We display the results in Table 27.1. Note that due to the random nature of the sampling, you will likely end up with a different subset of 5 rows. UN_data_m9 |&gt; slice_sample(n = 5) Table 27.1: A random sample of 5 out of the 193 total countries (181 without missing data) iso life_exp fert_rate obes_rate PRT 81.5 1.4 20.8 MNE 77.8 1.7 23.3 CPV 73.8 1.9 11.8 VNM 75.5 1.9 2.1 IDN 73.1 2.1 6.9 We have looked at the raw values in our UN_data_m9 data frame and got a preliminary sense of the data. We can now compute summary statistics. We start by computing the mean and median of our numerical outcome variable fert_rate and our numerical explanatory variable life_exp. We do this by using the summarize() function from dplyr along with the mean() and median() summary functions we saw in Section 24.2. UN_data_m9 |&gt; summarize(mean_life_exp = mean(life_exp), mean_fert_rate = mean(fert_rate), median_life_exp = median(life_exp), median_fert_rate = median(fert_rate)) mean_life_exp mean_fert_rate median_life_exp median_fert_rate 73.6 2.5 75.1 2 However, what if we want other summary statistics as well, such as the standard deviation (a measure of spread), the minimum and maximum values, and various percentiles? Typing all these summary statistic functions in summarize() would be long and tedious. Instead, we use the convenient tidy_summary() function in the moderndive package. This function takes in a data frame, summarizes it, and returns commonly used summary statistics in tidy format. We take our UN_data_m9 data frame, select() only the outcome and explanatory variables fert_rate and life_exp, and pipe them into the tidy_summary function: UN_data_m9 |&gt; select(fert_rate, life_exp) |&gt; tidy_summary() column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd fert_rate 181 numeric 1.1 1.6 2.5 2.0 3.2 6.6 1.15 life_exp 181 numeric 53.6 69.4 73.6 75.1 78.3 86.4 6.80 We can also do this more directly by providing which columns we’d like a summary of inside the tidy_summary() function: UN_data_m9 |&gt; tidy_summary(columns = c(fert_rate, life_exp)) column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd fert_rate 181 numeric 1.1 1.6 2.5 2.0 3.2 6.6 1.15 life_exp 181 numeric 53.6 69.4 73.6 75.1 78.3 86.4 6.80 Both return the same results for the numerical variables fert_rate and life_exp: column: the name of the column being summarized n: the number of non-missing values group: NA (missing) for numerical columns, but will break down a categorical variable into its levels type: which type of column is it (numeric, character, factor, or logical) min: the minimum value Q1: the 1st quartile: the value at which 25% of observations are smaller than it (the 25th percentile) mean: the average value for measuring central tendency median: the 2nd quartile: the value at which 50% of observations are smaller than it (the 50th percentile) Q3: the 3rd quartile: the value at which 75% of observations are smaller than it (the 75th percentile) max: the maximum value sd: the standard deviation value for measuring spread Looking at this output, we can see how the values of both variables distribute. For example, the median fertility rate was 2, whereas the median life expectancy was 75.14 years. The middle 50% of fertility rates was between 1.6 and 3.2 (the first and third quartiles), and the middle 50% of life expectancies was from 69.36 to 78.31. The tidy_summary() function only returns what are known as univariate summary statistics: functions that take a single variable and return some numerical summary of that variable. However, there also exist bivariate summary statistics: functions that take in two variables and return some summary of those two variables. In particular, when the two variables are numerical, we can compute the correlation coefficient. Generally speaking, coefficients are quantitative expressions of a specific phenomenon. A correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear relationship between two numerical variables. Its value goes from -1 and 1 where: -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship: As one variable increases, the value of the other variable tends to go down, following a straight line. 0 indicates no relationship: The values of both variables go up/down independently of each other. +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship: As the value of one variable goes up, the value of the other variable tends to go up as well in a linear fashion. Figure 27.1 gives examples of nine different correlation coefficient values for hypothetical numerical variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Figure 27.1: Nine different correlation coefficients. For example, observe in the top right plot that for a correlation coefficient of -0.75 there is a negative linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), but it is not as strong as the negative linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when the correlation coefficient is -0.9 or -1. The correlation coefficient can be computed using the get_correlation() function in the moderndive package. In this case, the inputs to the function are the two numerical variables for which we want to calculate the correlation coefficient. We put the name of the outcome variable on the left-hand side of the ~ “tilde” sign, while putting the name of the explanatory variable on the right-hand side. This is known as R’s formula notation. We will use this same “formula” syntax with regression later in this chapter. UN_data_m9 |&gt; get_correlation(formula = fert_rate ~ life_exp) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.811713 An alternative way to compute correlation is to use the cor() summary function within a summarize(): UN_data_m9 |&gt; summarize(correlation = cor(fert_rate, life_exp)) In our case, the correlation coefficient of -0.812 indicates that the relationship between fertility rate and life expectancy is “moderately negative.” There is a certain amount of subjectivity in interpreting correlation coefficients, especially those that are not close to the extreme values of -1, 0, and 1. We now perform the last step in EDA: creating data visualizations. Since both the fert_rate and life_exp variables are numerical, a scatterplot is an appropriate graph to visualize this data. We do this using geom_point() and display the result in Figure 27.2. Furthermore, we set the alpha value to 0.1 to check for any overplotting. ggplot(UN_data_m9, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + labs(x = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;) Figure 27.2: Scatterplot of relationship of life expectancy and fertility rate. We do not see much for overplotting due to little to no overlap in the points. Most life expectancy entries appear to fall between 70 and 80 years, while most fertility rate entries fall between 1.5 and 3.5 births. Furthermore, while opinions may vary, it is our opinion that the relationship between fertility rate and life expectancy is “moderately negative.” This is consistent with our earlier computed correlation coefficient of -0.812. We build on the scatterplot in Figure 27.2 by adding a “best-fitting” line: of all possible lines we can draw on this scatterplot, it is the line that “best” fits through the cloud of points. We do this by adding a new geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) layer to the ggplot() code that created the scatterplot in Figure 27.2. The method = \"lm\" argument sets the line to be a “linear model.” The se = FALSE argument suppresses standard error uncertainty bars. (We’ll define the concept of standard error later.) ggplot(UN_data_m9, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + labs(x = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship of life expectancy and fertility rate&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) Figure 27.3: Scatterplot of life expectancy and fertility rate with regression line. The line in the resulting Figure 27.3 is called a “regression line.” The regression line is a visual summary of the relationship between two numerical variables, in our case the outcome variable fert_rate and the explanatory variable life_exp. The negative slope of the blue line is consistent with our earlier observed correlation coefficient of -0.812 suggesting that there is a negative relationship between these two variables: as a country’s population has higher life expectancy it tends to have a lower fertility rate. We’ll see later, however, that while the correlation coefficient and the slope of a regression line always have the same sign (positive or negative), they typically do not have the same value. Furthermore, a regression line is “best-fitting” in that it minimizes some mathematical criteria. We present these mathematical criteria in Subsection 27.4.2, but we suggest you read this subsection only after first reading the rest of this section on regression with one numerical explanatory variable. 27.2.2 Simple linear regression You may recall from secondary/high school algebra that the equation of a line is \\(y = a + b\\cdot x\\). (Note that the \\(\\cdot\\) symbol is equivalent to the \\(\\times\\) “multiply by” mathematical symbol. We’ll use the \\(\\cdot\\) symbol in the rest of this book as it is more succinct.) It is defined by two coefficients \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The intercept coefficient \\(a\\) is the value of \\(y\\) when \\(x = 0\\). The slope coefficient \\(b\\) for \\(x\\) is the increase in \\(y\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). This is also called the “rise over run.” However, when defining a regression line like the one in Figure 27.3, we use slightly different notation: the equation of the regression line is \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\) . The intercept coefficient is \\(b_0\\), so \\(b_0\\) is the value of \\(\\widehat{y}\\) when \\(x = 0\\). The slope coefficient for \\(x\\) is \\(b_1\\), i.e., the increase in \\(\\widehat{y}\\) for every increase of one in \\(x\\). Why do we put a “hat” on top of the \\(y\\)? It’s a form of notation commonly used in regression to indicate that we have a “fitted value,” or the value of \\(y\\) on the regression line for a given \\(x\\) value as discussed further in Subsection 27.2.3. We know that the regression line in Figure 27.3 has a negative slope \\(b_1\\) corresponding to our explanatory \\(x\\) variable life_exp. Why? Because as countries tend to have higher life_exp values, they tend to have lower fert_rate values. However, what is the numerical value of the slope \\(b_1\\)? What about the intercept \\(b_0\\)? We do not compute these two values by hand, but rather we use a computer! We can obtain the values of the intercept \\(b_0\\) and the slope for life_exp \\(b_1\\) by outputting the linear regression coefficients. This is done in two steps: We first “fit” the linear regression model using the lm() function and save it in demographics_model. We get the regression coefficients by applying coef() to demographics_model. # Fit regression model: demographics_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp, data = UN_data_m9) # Get regression coefficients coef(demographics_model) We first focus on interpreting the regression coefficients, and later revisit the code that produced it. The coefficients are the intercept \\(b_0 = 12.599\\) and the slope \\(b_1 = -0.137\\) for life_exp. Thus the equation of the regression line in Figure 27.3 follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\\\ \\widehat{\\text{fertility}\\_\\text{rate}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy}} \\cdot \\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy}\\\\ &amp;= 12.599 + (-0.137) \\cdot \\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy} \\end{aligned} \\] The intercept \\(b_0\\) = 12.599 is the average fertility rate \\(\\widehat{y}\\) = \\(\\widehat{\\text{fertility}\\_\\text{rate}}\\) for those countries that had a life_exp of 0. Or in graphical terms, where the line intersects the \\(y\\) axis for \\(x\\) = 0. Note, however, that while the intercept of the regression line has a mathematical interpretation, it has no practical interpretation here, since observing a life_exp of 0 is impossible. Furthermore, looking at the scatterplot with the regression line in Figure 27.3, no countries had a life expectancy anywhere near 0. Of greater interest is the slope \\(b_{\\text{life}\\_\\text{expectancy}}\\) for life_exp of -0.137. This summarizes the relationship between the fertility rate and life expectancy variables. Note that the sign is negative, suggesting a negative relationship between these two variables. This means countries with higher life expectancies tend to have lower fertility rates. Recall that the correlation coefficient is -0.812. They both have the same negative sign, but have a different value. Recall also that the correlation’s interpretation is the “strength of linear association.” The slope’s interpretation is a little different: For every increase of 1 unit in life_exp, there is an associated decrease of, on average, 0.137 units of fert_rate. We only state that there is an associated increase and not necessarily a causal increase. Perhaps it may not be that higher life expectancies directly cause lower fertility rates. Instead, wealthier countries could tend to have stronger educational backgrounds, improved health, a higher standard of living, and have lower fertility rates, while at the same time these wealthy countries also tend to have higher life expectancies. Just because two variables are strongly associated, it does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. This is summed up in the often-quoted phrase, “correlation is not necessarily causation.” We discuss this idea further in Subsection 27.4.1. Furthermore, we say that this associated decrease is on average 0.137 units of fert_rate, because you might have two countries whose life_exp values differ by 1 unit, but their difference in fertility rates may not be exactly \\(-0.137\\). What the slope of \\(-0.137\\) is saying is that across all possible countries, the average difference in fertility rate between two countries whose life expectancies differ by one is \\(-0.137\\). Now that we have learned how to compute the equation for the regression line in Figure 27.3 using the model coefficient values and how to interpret the resulting intercept and slope, we revisit the code that generated these coefficients: # Fit regression model: demographics_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp, data = UN_data_m9) # Get regression coefficients: coef(demographics_model) First, we “fit” the linear regression model to the data using the lm() function and save this as demographics_model. When we say “fit,” we mean “find the best fitting line to this data.” lm() stands for “linear model” and is used as lm(y ~ x, data = df_name) where: y is the outcome variable, followed by a tilde ~. In our case, y is set to fert_rate. x is the explanatory variable. In our case, x is set to life_exp. The combination of y ~ x is called a model formula. (Note the order of y and x.) In our case, the model formula is fert_rate ~ life_exp. We saw such model formulas earlier with the get_correlation() function in Subsection 27.2.1. df_name is the name of the data frame that contains the variables y and x. In our case, data is the UN_data_m9 data frame. Second, we take the saved model in demographics_model and apply the coef() function to it to obtain the regression coefficients. This gives us the components of the regression equation line: the intercept \\(b_0\\) and the slope \\(b_1\\). 27.2.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals We just saw how to get the value of the intercept and the slope of a regression line from the output of the coef() function. Now instead say we want information on individual observations. For example, we focus on the 21st of the 181 countries in the UN_data_m9 data frame in Table 27.2. This corresponds to the UN member state of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH). Table 27.2: Data for the 21st country out of 193 iso life_exp fert_rate obes_rate BIH 78 1.3 17.9 What is the value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) on the regression line corresponding to this country’s life_exp value of 77.98? In Figure 27.4 we mark three values corresponding to these results for Bosnia and Herzegovina and give their statistical names: Circle: The observed value \\(y\\) = 1.3 is this country’s actual fertility rate. Square: The fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) is the value on the regression line for \\(x = \\texttt{life\\_exp} = 77.98\\), computed with the intercept and slope in the previous regression table: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x = 12.599 + (-0.137) \\cdot 77.98 = 1.894\\] * Arrow: The length of this arrow is the residual and is computed by subtracting the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) from the observed value \\(y\\). The residual can be thought of as a model’s error or “lack of fit” for a particular observation. In the case of this country, it is \\(y - \\widehat{y} = 1.3 - 1.894 = -0.594\\). Figure 27.4: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual. Now say we want to compute both the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x\\) and the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) for all 181 UN member states with complete data as of 2024. Recall that each country corresponds to one of the 181 rows in the UN_data_m9 data frame and also one of the 181 points in the regression plot in Figure 27.4. We could repeat the previous calculations we performed by hand 181 times, but that would be tedious and time consuming. Instead, we use a computer with the get_regression_points() function. We apply the get_regression_points() function to demographics_model, which is where we saved our lm() model in the previous section. In Table 27.3 we present the results of only the 21st through 24th courses for brevity. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(demographics_model) regression_points Table 27.3: Regression points (for only the 21st through 24th countries) ID fert_rate life_exp fert_rate_hat residual 21 1.3 78.0 1.89 -0.594 22 2.7 65.6 3.59 -0.888 23 1.6 75.9 2.18 -0.576 24 1.7 80.6 1.53 0.165 This function is an example of what is known in computer programming as a wrapper function. It takes other pre-existing functions and “wraps” them into a single function that hides its inner workings. This concept is illustrated in Figure 27.5. Figure 27.5: The concept of a wrapper function. So all you need to worry about is what the inputs look like and what the outputs look like; you leave all the other details “under the hood of the car.” In our regression modeling example, the get_regression_points() function takes a saved lm() linear regression model as input and returns a data frame of the regression predictions as output. If you are interested in learning more about the get_regression_points() function’s inner workings, check out Subsection 27.4.3. We inspect the individual columns and match them with the elements of Figure 27.4: The fert_rate column represents the observed outcome variable \\(y\\). This is the y-position of the 181 black points. The life_exp column represents the values of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). This is the x-position of the 181 black points. The fert_rate_hat column represents the fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\). This is the corresponding value on the regression line for the 181 \\(x\\) values. The residual column represents the residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\). This is the 181 vertical distances between the 181 black points and the regression line. Just as we did for the 21st country in the UN_data_m9 dataset (in the first row of the table), we repeat the calculations for the 24th country (in the fourth row of Table 27.3). This corresponds to the country of Brunei (BRN): fert_rate \\(= 1.7\\) is the observed fert_rate \\(y\\) for this country. life_exp \\(= 80.590\\) is the value of the explanatory variable life_exp \\(x\\) for Brunei. fert_rate_hat \\(= 1.535 = 12.599 + (-0.137) \\cdot 80.590\\) is the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) on the regression line for this country. residual \\(= 0.165 = 1.7 - 1.535\\) is the value of the residual for this country. In other words, the model’s fitted value was off by 0.165 fertility rate units for Brunei. If you like, you can skip ahead to Subsection 27.4.2 to learn about the processes behind what makes “best-fitting” regression lines. As a primer, a “best-fitting” line refers to the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals out of all possible lines we can draw through the points. In Section 27.3, we’ll discuss another common scenario of having a categorical explanatory variable and a numerical outcome variable. 27.3 One categorical explanatory variable It is an unfortunate truth that life expectancy is not the same across all countries in the world. International development agencies are interested in studying these differences in life expectancy in the hopes of identifying where governments should allocate resources to address this problem. In this section, we explore differences in life expectancy in two ways: Differences between continents: Are there significant differences in average life expectancy between the six populated continents of the world: Africa, North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania? Differences within continents: How does life expectancy vary within the world’s five continents? For example, is the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Africa larger than the spread of life expectancy among the countries of Asia? To answer such questions, we use an updated version of the gapminder data frame we visualized in Figure 21.1 in Subsection 21.2.2 on the grammar of graphics. This updated un_member_states_2024 data we saw earlier in this chapter. It is included in the moderndive package and has international development statistics such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population for 193 countries for years near 2024. We use this data for basic regression again, but now using an explanatory variable \\(x\\) that is categorical, as opposed to the numerical explanatory variable model we used in the previous Section 27.2: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) (a country’s life expectancy) and A single categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) (the continent that the country is a part of). When the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is categorical, the concept of a “best-fitting” regression line is a little different than the one we saw previously in Section 27.2 where the explanatory variable \\(x\\) was numerical. We study these differences shortly in Subsection 27.3.2, but first we conduct an exploratory data analysis. 27.3.1 Exploratory data analysis The data on the 193 countries can be found in the un_member_states_2024 data frame included in the moderndive package. However, to keep things simple, we select() only the subset of the variables we’ll consider in this chapter and focus only on rows where we have no missing values with na.omit(). We’ll save this data in a new data frame called gapminder2022: gapminder2022 &lt;- un_member_states_2024 |&gt; select(country, life_exp = life_expectancy_2022, continent, gdp_per_capita) |&gt; na.omit() We perform the first common step in an exploratory data analysis: looking at the raw data values. You can do this by using RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using the glimpse() command as introduced in Subsection 6.4.3 on exploring data frames: glimpse(gapminder2022) Rows: 188 Columns: 4 $ country &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Afghanistan&quot;, &quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;, &quot;Andorra&quot;, &quot;Angola… $ life_exp &lt;dbl&gt; 53.6, 79.5, 78.0, 83.4, 62.1, 77.8, 78.3, 76.1, 83.1, 8… $ continent &lt;fct&gt; Asia, Europe, Africa, Europe, Africa, North America, So… $ gdp_per_capita &lt;dbl&gt; 356, 6810, 4343, 41993, 3000, 19920, 13651, 7018, 65100… Observe that Rows: 188 indicates that there are 188 rows/observations in gapminder2022, where each row corresponds to one country. In other words, the observational unit is an individual country. Furthermore, observe that the variable continent is of type &lt;fct&gt;, which stands for factor, which is R’s way of encoding categorical variables. A full description of all the variables included in un_member_states_2024 can be found by reading the associated help file (run ?un_member_states_2024 in the console). However, we fully describe only the 4 variables we selected in gapminder2022: country: An identification variable of type character/text used to distinguish the 188 countries in the dataset. life_exp: A numerical variable of that country’s life expectancy at birth. This is the outcome variable \\(y\\) of interest. continent: A categorical variable with five levels. Here “levels” correspond to the possible categories: Africa, Asia, Americas, Europe, and Oceania. This is the explanatory variable \\(x\\) of interest. gdp_per_capita: A numerical variable of that country’s GDP per capita in US inflation-adjusted dollars that we’ll use as another outcome variable \\(y\\) in the Learning check at the end of this subsection. We next look at a random sample of three out of the 188 countries in Table 27.4. gapminder2022 |&gt; sample_n(size = 3) Table 27.4: Random sample of 3 out of 188 countries country life_exp continent gdp_per_capita Panama 77.6 North America 17358 Micronesia, Federated States of 74.4 Oceania 3714 Burundi 67.4 Africa 259 Random sampling will likely produce a different subset of 3 rows for you than what’s shown. Now that we have looked at the raw values in our gapminder2022 data frame and got a sense of the data, we compute summary statistics. We again apply tidy_summary() from the moderndive package. Recall that this function takes in a data frame, summarizes it, and returns commonly used summary statistics. We take our gapminder2022 data frame, select() only the outcome and explanatory variables life_exp and continent, and pipe them into tidy_summary() in Table 27.5: gapminder2022 |&gt; select(life_exp, continent) |&gt; tidy_summary() Table 27.5: Summary of life expectancy and continent variables column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd life_exp 188 numeric 53.6 69.4 73.8 75.2 78.4 89.6 6.93 continent 52 Africa factor continent 44 Asia factor continent 43 Europe factor continent 23 North America factor continent 14 Oceania factor continent 12 South America factor The tidy_summary() output now reports summaries for categorical variables and for the numerical variables we reviewed before. Let’s focus just on discussing the results for the categorical factor variable continent: n: The number of non-missing entries for each group group: Breaks down a categorical variable into its unique levels. For this variable, it is corresponding to Africa, Asia, North and South America, Europe, and Oceania. type: The data type of the variable. Here, it is a factor. min to sd: These are missing since calculating the five-number summary, the mean, and standard deviation for categorical variables doesn’t make sense. Turning our attention to the summary statistics of the numerical variable life_exp, we observe that the global median life expectancy in 2022 was 75.14. Thus, half of the world’s countries (96 countries) had a life expectancy of less than 75.14. The mean life expectancy of 73.55 is lower, however. Why is the mean life expectancy lower than the median? We can answer this question by performing the last of the three common steps in an exploratory data analysis: creating data visualizations. We visualize the distribution of our outcome variable \\(y\\) = life_exp in Figure 27.6. ggplot(gapminder2022, aes(x = life_exp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Number of countries&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of distribution of worldwide life expectancies&quot;) Figure 27.6: Histogram of life expectancy in 2022. We see that this data is left-skewed, also known as negatively skewed: there are a few countries with low life expectancy that are bringing down the mean life expectancy. However, the median is less sensitive to the effects of such outliers; hence, the median is greater than the mean in this case. Remember, however, that we want to compare life expectancies both between continents and within continents. In other words, our visualizations need to incorporate some notion of the variable continent. We can do this easily with a faceted histogram. Recall from Section 21.6 that facets allow us to split a visualization by the different values of another variable. We display the resulting visualization in Figure 27.7 by adding a facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) layer. ggplot(gapminder2022, aes(x = life_exp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Number of countries&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of distribution of worldwide life expectancies&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 2) Figure 27.7: Life expectancy in 2022 by continent (faceted). Observe that unfortunately the distribution of African life expectancies is much lower than the other continents. In Europe, life expectancies tend to be higher and furthermore do not vary as much. On the other hand, both Asia and Africa have the most variation in life expectancies. Recall that an alternative method to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable split by a categorical variable is by using a side-by-side boxplot. We map the categorical variable continent to the \\(x\\)-axis and the different life expectancies within each continent on the \\(y\\)-axis in Figure 27.8. ggplot(gapminder2022, aes(x = continent, y = life_exp)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Continent&quot;, y = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, title = &quot;Life expectancy by continent&quot;) Figure 27.8: Life expectancy in 2022 by continent (boxplot). Some people prefer comparing the distributions of a numerical variable between different levels of a categorical variable using a boxplot instead of a faceted histogram. This is because we can make quick comparisons between the categorical variable’s levels with imaginary horizontal lines. For example, observe in Figure 27.8 that we can quickly convince ourselves that Europe has the highest median life expectancies by drawing an imaginary horizontal line near \\(y = 81\\). Furthermore, as we observed in the faceted histogram in Figure 27.7, Africa and Asia have the largest variation in life expectancy as evidenced by their large interquartile ranges (the size of the boxes). It’s important to remember, however, that the solid lines in the middle of the boxes correspond to the medians (the middle value) rather than the mean (the average). So, for example, if you look at Asia, the solid line denotes the median life expectancy of around 75 years. This tells us that half of all countries in Asia have a life expectancy below 75 years, whereas half have a life expectancy above 75 years. We compute the median and mean life expectancy for each continent with a little more data wrangling and display the results in Table 27.6. life_exp_by_continent &lt;- gapminder2022 |&gt; group_by(continent) |&gt; summarize(median = median(life_exp), mean = mean(life_exp)) life_exp_by_continent Table 27.6: Life expectancy by continent continent median mean Africa 66.1 66.3 Asia 75.4 75.0 Europe 81.5 79.9 North America 76.1 76.3 Oceania 74.6 74.4 South America 75.4 75.2 Observe the order of the second column median life expectancy: Africa is lowest, Europe the highest, and the others have similar medians between Africa and Europe. This ordering corresponds to the ordering of the solid black lines inside the boxes in our side-by-side boxplot in Figure 27.8. We now turn our attention to the values in the third column mean. Using Africa’s mean life expectancy of 66.31 as a baseline for comparison, we start making comparisons to the mean life expectancies of the other four continents and put these values in Table 27.7, which we’ll revisit later on in this section. For Asia, it is 74.95 - 66.31 = 8.64 years higher. For Europe, it is 79.91 - 66.31 = 13.6 years higher. For North America, it is 76.29 - 66.31 = 9.98 years higher. For Oceania, it is 74.42 - 66.31 = 8.11 years higher. For South America, it is 75.23 - 66.31 = 8.92 years higher. Table 27.7: Mean life expectancy by continent and relative differences from mean for Africa continent mean Difference versus Africa Africa 66.3 0.00 Asia 75.0 8.64 Europe 79.9 13.60 North America 76.3 9.99 Oceania 74.4 8.11 South America 75.2 8.92 27.3.2 Linear regression In Subsection 27.2.2 we introduced simple linear regression, which involves modeling the relationship between a numerical outcome variable \\(y\\) and a numerical explanatory variable \\(x\\). In our life expectancy example, we now instead have a categorical explanatory variable continent. Our model will not yield a “best-fitting” regression line like in Figure 27.3, but rather offsets relative to a baseline for comparison. As we did in Subsection 27.2.2 when studying the relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy, we output the regression coefficients for this model. Recall that this is done in two steps: We “fit” the linear regression model using lm(y ~ x, data) and save it in life_exp_model. We get the regression coefficients by applying the coef() function to life_exp_model. life_exp_model &lt;- lm(life_exp ~ continent, data = gapminder2022) coef(life_exp_model) (Intercept) continentAsia continentEurope 66.31 8.64 13.60 continentNorth America continentOceania continentSouth America 9.99 8.11 8.92 We once again focus on the values in these coefficient values. Why are there now 6 entries? We break them down one by one: intercept corresponds to the mean life expectancy of countries in Africa of 66.31 years. continentAsia corresponds to countries in Asia and the value +8.64 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 27.7. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in Asia is \\(66.31 + 8.64 = 74.95\\). continentEurope corresponds to countries in Europe and the value +13.6 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 27.7. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in Europe is \\(66.31 + 13.6 = 79.91\\). continentNorth America corresponds to countries in North America and the value +9.98 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 27.7. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in North America is \\(66.31 + 9.98 = 76.29\\). continentOceania corresponds to countries in Oceania and the value +8.11 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 27.7. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in Oceania is \\(66.31 + 8.11 = 74.42\\). continentSouth America corresponds to countries in South America and the value +8.92 is the same difference in mean life expectancy relative to Africa we displayed in Table 27.7. In other words, the mean life expectancy of countries in South America is \\(66.31 + 8.92 = 75.23\\). To summarize, the 6 values for the regression coefficients correspond to the “baseline for comparison” continent Africa (the intercept) as well as five “offsets” from this baseline for the remaining 5 continents: Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. You might be asking at this point why was Africa chosen as the “baseline for comparison” group. This is the case for no other reason than it comes first alphabetically of the six continents; by default R arranges factors/categorical variables in alphanumeric order. You can change this baseline group to be another continent if you manipulate the variable continent’s factor “levels” using the forcats package. See Chapter 15 of R for Data Science for examples. We now write the equation for our fitted values \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{life exp}}\\). \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania }}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Euro}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\end{aligned} \\] Whoa! That looks daunting! Don’t fret, however, as once you understand what all the elements mean, things simplify greatly. First, \\(\\mathbb{1}_{A}(x)\\) is what’s known in mathematics as an “indicator function.” It returns only one of two possible values, 0 and 1, where \\[ \\mathbb{1}_{A}(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if } x \\text{ is in } A \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. \\] In a statistical modeling context, this is also known as a dummy variable. In our case, we consider the first such indicator variable \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Amer}}(x)\\). This indicator function returns 1 if a country is in the Asia, 0 otherwise: \\[ \\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Amer}}(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if } \\text{country } x \\text{ is in Asia} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] Second, \\(b_0\\) corresponds to the intercept as before; in this case, it is the mean life expectancy of all countries in Africa. Third, the \\(b_{\\text{Asia}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{Europe}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{North America}}\\), \\(b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\), and \\(b_{\\text{South America}}\\) represent the 5 “offsets relative to the baseline for comparison” in the regression coefficients. We put this all together and compute the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{life exp}}\\) for a country in Africa. Since the country is in Africa, all five indicator functions \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x)\\), \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\), \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x)\\), \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x)\\), and \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\) will equal 0, and thus: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot 0 + 13.6\\cdot 0 + 9.98\\cdot 0 + 8.11\\cdot 0 + 8.92\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 \\end{aligned} \\] In other words, all that is left is the intercept \\(b_0\\), corresponding to the average life expectancy of African countries of 66.31 years. Next, say we are considering a country in Asia. In this case, only the indicator function \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x)\\) for Asia will equal 1, while all the others will equal 0, and thus: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot 1 + 13.6\\cdot 0 + 9.98\\cdot 0 + 8.11\\cdot 0 + 8.92\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64 \\\\ &amp; = 74.95 \\end{aligned} \\] which is the mean life expectancy for countries in Asia of 74.95 years in Table 27.7. Note the “offset from the baseline for comparison” is +8.64 years. We do one more. Say we are considering a country in South America. In this case, only the indicator function \\(\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\) for South America will equal 1, while all the others will equal 0, and thus: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{\\text{life exp}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{\\text{Asia}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + b_{\\text{Europe}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{North America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + b_{\\text{Oceania}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) \\\\ &amp; \\qquad + b_{\\text{South America}}\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x) \\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Asia}}(x) + 13.6\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Europe}}(x)\\\\ &amp; \\qquad + 9.98\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{North America}}(x) + 8.11\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{Oceania}}(x) + 8.92\\cdot\\mathbb{1}_{\\text{South America}}(x)\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.64\\cdot 0 + 13.6\\cdot 0 + 9.98\\cdot 0 + 8.11\\cdot 0 + 8.92\\cdot 1\\\\ &amp;= 66.31 + 8.92 \\\\ &amp; = 75.23 \\end{aligned} \\] which is the mean life expectancy for South American countries of 75.23 years in Table 27.7. The “offset from the baseline for comparison” here is +8.64 years. We generalize this idea a bit. If we fit a linear regression model using a categorical explanatory variable \\(x\\) that has \\(k\\) possible categories, the regression table will return an intercept and \\(k - 1\\) “offsets.” In our case, since there are \\(k = 6\\) continents, the regression model returns an intercept corresponding to the baseline for comparison group of Africa and \\(k - 1 = 5\\) offsets corresponding to Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. Understanding a regression table output when you are using a categorical explanatory variable is a topic those new to regression often struggle with. The only real remedy for these struggles is practice, practice, practice. However, once you equip yourselves with an understanding of how to create regression models using categorical explanatory variables, you’ll be able to incorporate many new variables into your models, given the large amount of the world’s data that is categorical. 27.3.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals Recall in Subsection 27.2.3, we defined the following three concepts: Observed values \\(y\\), or the observed value of the outcome variable Fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\), or the value on the regression line for a given \\(x\\) value Residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\), or the error between the observed value and the fitted value We obtained these values and other values using the get_regression_points() function from the moderndive package. This time, however, we add an argument setting ID = \"country\", which uses the variable country in gapminder2022 as an identification variable in the output. This will help contextualize our analysis by matching values to countries. get_regression_points(life_exp_model, ID = &quot;country&quot;) Table 27.8: Regression points (Sample of 6 out of 142 countries) country life_exp continent life_exp_hat residual Afghanistan 53.6 Asia 75.0 -21.300 Albania 79.5 Europe 79.9 -0.438 Algeria 78.0 Africa 66.3 11.720 Angola 62.1 Africa 66.3 -4.200 Argentina 78.3 South America 75.2 3.083 Barbados 78.5 North America 76.3 2.255 Observe in Table 27.8 that life_exp_hat contains the fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) = \\(\\widehat{\\text{life exp}}\\). If you look closely, there are only 5 possible values for life_exp_hat. These correspond to the five mean life expectancies for the 5 continents that we displayed in Table 27.7 and computed using the regression coefficient values. The residual column is simply \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = life_exp - life_exp_hat. These values can be interpreted as the deviation of a country’s life expectancy from its continent’s average life expectancy. For example, observe the first row of Table 27.8 corresponding to Afghanistan. The residual of \\(y - \\widehat{y} = 53.6 - 74.95 = -21.4\\) refers to Afghanistan’s life expectancy being 21.4 years lower than the mean life expectancy of all Asian countries. This is partly explained by the years of war that country has suffered. 27.4 Related topics 27.4.1 Correlation is not necessarily causation Throughout this chapter we have been cautious when interpreting regression slope coefficients. We always discussed the “associated” effect of an explanatory variable \\(x\\) on an outcome variable \\(y\\). For example, our statement from Subsection 27.2.2 that “for every increase of 1 unit in life_exp, there is an associated decrease of on average 0.137 units of fert_rate.” We include the term “associated” to be extra careful not to suggest we are making a causal statement. So while life_exp is negatively correlated with fert_rate, we can’t necessarily make any statements about life expectancy’s direct causal effect on fertility rates without more information. Here is another example depicted in Figure 27.9: a not-so-great medical doctor goes through medical records and finds that patients who slept with their shoes on tended to wake up more with headaches. So this doctor declares, “Sleeping with shoes on causes headaches!” Figure 27.9: Does sleeping with shoes on cause headaches? However, there is a good chance that if someone is sleeping with their shoes on, it is potentially because they are intoxicated from alcohol. Furthermore, higher levels of drinking leads to more hangovers, and hence more headaches. The amount of alcohol consumption here is what’s known as a confounding/lurking variable. It “lurks” behind the scenes, confounding the causal relationship (if any) of “sleeping with shoes on” with “waking up with a headache.” We can summarize this in Figure 27.10 with a causal graph where Y is a response variable and X is a treatment variable whose causal effect we are interested in. Figure 27.10: Causal graph. To study the relationship between Y and X, we could use a regression model where the outcome variable is set to Y and the explanatory variable is set to be X, as you’ve been doing throughout this chapter. However, Figure 27.10 also includes a third variable with arrows pointing at both X and Y: Z is a confounding variable that affects both X and Y, thereby “confounding” their relationship. Here the confounding variable is alcohol. Alcohol will cause people to be both more likely to sleep with their shoes on as well as be more likely to wake up with a headache. Thus any regression model of the relationship between X and Y should also use Z as an explanatory variable. In other words, our doctor needs to take into account who had been drinking the night before. In the next chapter, we’ll start covering multiple regression models that allow us to incorporate more than one variable in our regression models. Establishing causation is a tricky problem and frequently takes either carefully designed experiments or methods to control for the effects of confounding variables. Both these approaches attempt, as best they can, either to take all possible confounding variables into account or negate their impact. This allows researchers to focus only on the relationship of interest: the relationship between the outcome variable Y and the treatment variable X. As you read news stories, be careful not to fall into the trap of thinking that correlation necessarily implies causation. Check out the Spurious Correlations website for some comical examples of variables that are correlated, but are not causally related. Coming back to our UN member states data, a confounding variable could be the level of economic development of a country. This could affect both life expectancy and fertility rates. A proxy for looking at the level of economic development could be the Human Development Index (HDI). It measures a country’s average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: health (life expectancy), education (mean and expected years of schooling), and standard of living (gross national income per capita). This is stored in the hdi_2022 column of un_member_states_2024. We explore its relationship with life expectancy and fertility rates: ggplot(data = un_member_states_2024, aes(x = hdi_2022, y = life_expectancy_2022)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Human Development Index (HDI)&quot;, y = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;) ggplot(data = un_member_states_2024, aes(x = hdi_2022, y = fertility_rate_2022)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Human Development Index (HDI)&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;) un_member_states_2024 |&gt; get_correlation(life_expectancy_2022 ~ hdi_2022, na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.888935 un_member_states_2024 |&gt; get_correlation(fertility_rate_2022 ~ hdi_2022, na.rm = TRUE) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.848977 Looking at both of the scatterplots above, we see a strong positive linear relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and life expectancy, as well as a strong negative correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and fertility rates. The correlation coefficients between the Human Development Index (HDI) and life expectancy, as well as the Human Development Index (HDI) and fertility rates, are also given. These findings as well as some additional understanding of socioeconomic factors suggest that the Human Development Index (HDI) is a confounding variable in the relationship between life expectancy and fertility rates. 27.4.2 Best-fitting line Regression lines are also known as “best-fitting” lines. But what do we mean by “best”? We unpack the criteria that is used in regression to determine “best.” Recall Figure 27.4, where for Bosnia and Herzegovina we marked the observed value \\(y\\) with a circle, the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) with a square, and the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) with an arrow. We re-display Figure 27.4 in the top-left plot of Figure 27.11 in addition to three more arbitrarily chosen countries: Figure 27.11: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual. The four plots refer to: The country of Bosnia and Herzegovina had a life expectancy \\(x = 77.98\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 1.3\\). The residual in this case is \\(1.3 - 1.894 = -0.594\\), which we mark with an blue arrow in the top-left plot. The addition of Chad, which had a life expectancy \\(x = 59.15\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 6\\). The residual in this case is \\(6 - 4.479 = 1.521\\), which we mark with a new blue arrow in the top-right plot. The addition of India, which had a life expectancy \\(x = 67.22\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 2\\). The residual in this case is \\(2 - 3.371 = -1.371\\), which we mark with a new blue arrow in the bottom-left plot. The addition of the Solomon Islands, which had a life expectancy \\(x = 76.7\\) and fertility rate \\(y = 3.8\\). The residual in this case is \\(3.8 - 2.069 = 1.731\\), which we mark with a new blue arrow in the bottom-right plot. Now say we repeated this process of computing residuals for all 181 countries with complete information, then we squared all the residuals, and then we summed them. We call this quantity the sum of squared residuals; it is a measure of the lack of fit of a model. Larger values of the sum of squared residuals indicate a bigger lack of fit. This corresponds to a worse-fitting model. If the regression line fits all the points perfectly, then the sum of squared residuals is 0. This is because if the regression line fits all the points perfectly, then the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}\\) equals the observed value \\(y\\) in all cases, and hence the residual \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) = 0 in all cases, and the sum of even a large number of 0’s is still 0. Furthermore, of all possible lines we can draw through the cloud of 181 points, the regression line minimizes this value. In other words, the regression and its corresponding fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) minimizes the sum of the squared residuals: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i)^2 \\] We use our data-wrangling tools to compute the sum of squared residuals exactly: # Fit regression model and regression points demographics_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp, data = UN_data_m9) regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(demographics_model) # Compute sum of squared residuals regression_points |&gt; mutate(squared_residuals = residual^2) |&gt; summarize(sum_of_squared_residuals = sum(squared_residuals)) [1] 81.3 Any other straight line drawn in the figure would yield a sum of squared residuals greater than 81.265. This is a mathematically guaranteed fact that you can prove using calculus and linear algebra. That’s why alternative names for the linear regression line are the best-fitting line and the least-squares line. Why do we square the residuals (i.e., the arrow lengths)? So that both positive and negative deviations of the same amount are treated equally. (That being said, while taking the absolute value of the residuals would also treat both positive and negative deviations of the same amount equally, squaring the residuals is used for reasons related to calculus: taking derivatives and minimizing functions. To learn more we suggest you consult a textbook on mathematical statistics.) 27.4.3 get_regression_x() functions Recall in this chapter we introduced a wrapper function from the moderndive package: get_regression_points() that returns point-by-point information from a regression model in Subsection 27.2.3. What is going on behind the scenes with the get_regression_points() function? We mentioned in Subsection 27.2.2 that this was an example of a wrapper function. Such functions take other pre-existing functions and “wrap” them into single functions that hide the user from their inner workings. This way all the user needs to worry about is what the inputs look like and what the outputs look like. In this subsection, we’ll “get under the hood” of these functions and see how the “engine” of these wrapper functions works. The get_regression_points() function is a wrapper function, returning information about the individual points involved in a regression model like the fitted values, observed values, and the residuals. get_regression_points() uses the augment() function in the broom package to produce the data shown in Table 27.9. Additionally, it uses clean_names() from the janitor package [@R-janitor] to clean up the variable names. library(broom) library(janitor) demographics_model |&gt; augment() |&gt; mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 3) |&gt; clean_names() |&gt; select(-c(&quot;std_resid&quot;, &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;, &quot;cooksd&quot;, &quot;std_resid&quot;)) Table 27.9: Regression points using augment() from broom package fert_rate life_exp fitted resid 4.3 53.6 5.23 -0.934 1.4 79.5 1.69 -0.289 2.7 78.0 1.89 0.813 5.0 62.1 4.07 0.928 1.6 77.8 1.92 -0.318 1.9 78.3 1.85 0.052 1.6 76.1 2.15 -0.548 1.6 83.1 1.19 0.408 1.5 82.3 1.30 0.195 1.6 74.2 2.42 -0.819 In this case, it outputs only the variables of interest to students learning regression: the outcome variable \\(y\\) (fert_rate), all explanatory/predictor variables (life_exp), all resulting fitted values \\(\\hat{y}\\) used by applying the equation of the regression line to life_exp, and the residual \\(y - \\hat{y}\\). If you are even more curious about how these and other wrapper functions work, take a look at the source code for these functions on GitHub. 27.5 Conclusion In this chapter, you’ve studied the term basic regression, where you fit models that only have one explanatory variable. In the next module, we’ll study multiple regression, where our regression models can now have more than one explanatory variable! In particular, we’ll consider two scenarios: regression models with one numerical and one categorical explanatory variable and regression models with two numerical explanatory variables. This will allow you to construct more sophisticated and more powerful models, all in the hopes of better explaining your outcome variable \\(y\\). 27.6 References Grolemund, G., &amp; Wickham, H.

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. 29.1 Introduction In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people found social media to be more important than ever before. It kept us informed and connected during an unprecedented moment in time. People used major social media platforms for all kinds of things, from following and posting news, to organizing aid—such as coordinating the donations of masks across international boundaries—to sharing tips on working from home to, of course, pure entertainment. At the same time, the content moderation challenges faced by social media platforms didn’t disappear—and in some cases were exacerbated by the pandemic. Though the benefits of social media platforms may be obvious, and even seem utopian at times, the perils are also painfully apparent, more so every day: the pornographic, the obscene, the violent, the illegal, the abusive, and the hateful. So, social media platforms must, in some form or another, moderate—that is, take down, otherwise penalize, or at least flag certain kinds of content. Content moderation is important: to protect one user from another, to shield one group from its antagonists, and to remove the offensive, vile, or illegal. From a more self-serving perspective, platforms also want to present their best face to new users, to their advertisers and partners, and to the public at large. In the early weeks of the pandemic, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook all made public statements about their moderation strategies at that time. While they differed in details, they all had one key element in common: the increased reliance on automated tools. These companies described their increased reliance on automation in terms of ensuring the wellbeing of their content moderation teams and the privacy of their users. This is hard to argue with: Most social media companies rely on workers from the Global South to review flagged content, usually under precarious working conditions and without adequate protections from the traumatic effects of their work. While the goal to protect workers from being exposed to these dangers while working from home is certainly legitimate, automated content moderation still poses a number of problems. 29.2 Regression and Automated Content Moderation Why read about content moderation in the context of regression? Well, we’re just skimming the surface of regression in this class. Regression is a whole family of statistical techniques, ranging from the relatively simple to the overwhelmingly complex. I’ve heard data scientists joke that fancy terms like machine learning and artificial intelligence are just fancy labels for what is actually just a regression analysis, and there’s some truth to that! While it’s hard to say what the details are of a particular platform’s automated content moderation process are (more on this later!), regression is going to be involved somewhere. As we read about last week, one of the applications of regression (especially in machine learning) is in prediction. While we aren’t using regression in this way in this course, it’s important for us to recognize that many of the technologies we use every day are applying regression to make predictions. In particular, automated content moderation is about prediction—can we get the computer to predict whether or not an image or some text is the kind of thing that we ought to remove from a platform? There’s no denying that that can be helpful! What happens, though, if we get the prediction wrong? 29.3 The Problem with Automated Content Moderation Automated content moderation doesn’t work at scale; it can’t read nuance in speech the way humans can, and for some languages it barely works at all. Over the years, we’ve seen the use of automation result in numerous wrongful takedowns. In short: automation is not a sufficient replacement for having a human in the loop. And that’s a problem, especially when the COVID-19 pandemic increased our reliance on online platforms to speak, educate and learn. Conferences moved online, schools relied on online platforms, and individuals tuned in to videos to learn everything from yoga to gardening. Likewise, platforms continued to provide space for vital information, be it messages from governments to people, or documentation of human rights violations. It’s important to give credit where credit is due. In their announcements, YouTube and Twitter both acknowledged the shortcomings of artificial intelligence, and are taking that into account as they moderate content. YouTube decided not to issue strikes on video content except in cases where they have “high confidence” that it violates their rules, and Twitter announced it would only be issuing temporary suspensions—not permanent bans. For its part, Facebook acknowledged that it would be relying on full-time employees to moderate certain types of content, such as terrorism. These temporary measures helped mitigate the inevitable over-moderation that follows from the use of automated tools. However, history suggests that protocols adopted in times of crisis often persist when the crisis is over, and we’ve seen that happen as the pandemic has become less severe. Just because many COVID-19 restrictions have been eased doesn’t mean that automated content moderation has gone away. In fact, it didn’t begin with COVID-19! Automated moderation is cheaper and faster than human moderation—which is a soul-sucking, punishing task—so it’s always going to be used to a certain extent in efforts to reduce costs and trauma. Again, those are good motivations, so we shouldn’t rule out the value of data science-driven automated content moderation. However, The Santa Clara Principles for content moderation—authored by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and other organizations—begin with a statement on how and when it should be used: Companies should ensure that human rights and due process considerations are integrated at all stages of the content moderation process, and should publish information outlining how this integration is made. Companies should only use automated processes to identify or remove content or suspend accounts, whether supplemented by human review or not, when there is sufficiently high confidence in the quality and accuracy of those processes. Companies should also provide users with clear and accessible methods of obtaining support in the event of content and account actions. Companies like Apple, Meta, Google, Reddit, and Twitter have all endorsed these principles, but that’s no guarantee that they’ll actually follow through. In fact, Twitter’s approach to content moderation (not to mention its name) has changed drastically in recent months—and in a way that demonstrates the shortcomings of automated approaches. All social media users ought to be interested in how companies rely on automated content moderation. 29.4 An Example from Instagram In October 2020, the EFF argued that a then-recent Facebook transparency report showed that the company’s increased use of automated content moderation during the COVID-19 pandemic lacked in both human oversight and options for appeals. Those gaps increase the power of automated moderation techniques—and make the consequences of failed predictions more severe. Let’s walk through this argument in some more detail: When content is removed on Instagram, people typically have the option to contest takedown decisions. In short, there’s a recognition that an automated moderation system might make a mistake, so users can make a case for that. Typically, when the appeals process is initiated, the deleted material is reviewed by a human moderator and the takedown decision can get reversed and content reinstated. During the increased use of automated moderation, however, that option was seriously limited, with users receiving notification that their appeal may not be considered. According to the transparency report, there were zero appeals on Instagram during the second quarter of 2020—this doesn’t mean that Instagram’s automated content moderation didn’t make mistakes, just that it didn’t fix any of them. While Instagram also occasionally restores content on its own accord, user appeals usually trigger the vast majority of content that gets reinstated. So, heavier reliance on automated moderation means fewer human-reviewed appeals, which means more mistakes that can’t get corrected. An example: in Q2 of 2020, more than 380,000 posts that allegedly contained terrorist content were removed from Instagram, fewer than the 440,000 in Q1 (when Instagram wasn’t so reliant on automation because COVID-19 mostly hadn’t picked up yet). While around 8,100 takedowns were appealed by users in Q1, that number plummeted to zero in Q2. Looking at the number of posts restored, the impact of the lack of user appeals becomes apparent: During the first quarter, 500 pieces of content were restored after an appeal from a user, compared to the 190 posts that were reinstated without an appeal. In Q2, with no appeal system available to users, merely 70 posts of the several hundred thousand posts that allegedly contained terrorist content were restored, and more people had to deal with the consequences of a failed prediction. To be clear: Instagram should be taking down terrorist content from their platforms! That’s a good thing, and an example of why everyone should endorse content moderation, even if people disagree over the details. However, evidence of human rights violations and war crimes often gets caught in the net of automated content moderation as algorithms have a hard time differentiating between actual “terrorist” content and efforts to record and archive violent events. In a similar example, YouTube took down a video in June 2022 that had been posted by the January 6th House Select Committee. The rationale behind the takedown was that the video contained election misinformation. It did contain election misinformation, but for the purposes of documenting and criticizing that misinformation, not as an endorsement of that misinformation! It’s not clear whether this was the result of automated or human moderation, but if human content moderators make mistakes, automated moderators are even less trustworthy. Why does this matter? First of all, because this negative impact of automated content detection is disproportionately borne by Muslim and Arab communities. Second, because even though Instagram and Facebook are operated by the same company, there were inconsistencies in how the two platforms moderated content. The report in question, which listed data for the last two quarters of 2019 and the first two of 2020, did not consistently report the data on the same categories across the two platforms. Similarly, the granularity of data reported for various categories of content differed depending on platform. These may seem like small details, but they’re pretty big inconsistencies given that both platforms are owned by the same company. These differences in how one company enforces its rules across two platforms further highlights how difficult it is to deal with the problem of violent content through automated content moderation alone. 29.5 Conclusion As machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to develop, people and organizations are increasingly using them (and their underlying regression models) to make predictions about the world. It’s impressive how many predictions these tools get right, but the more dependent we become on these tools, the greater the consequences of a failed prediction. It’s important for us as data scientists—and perhaps even more as citizens—to be aware of the shortcomings of these techniques!

Furthermore, to keep things simple, we only considered models with one explanatory \\(x\\) variable that was either numerical in Section 27.2 or categorical in Section 27.3. In this chapter, we introduce multiple linear regression, the direct extension to simple linear regression when more than one explanatory variable is taken into account to explain changes in the outcome variable. As we show in the next few sections, much of the material developed for simple linear regression translates directly into multiple linear regression, but the interpretation of the associated effect of any one explanatory variable must be made taking into account the other explanatory variables included in the model. Needed packages If needed, read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(ISLR2) 30.1 One numerical and one categorical explanatory variable We continue using the UN member states dataset introduced in Section 27.2. Recall that we studied the relationship between the outcome variable fertility rate, \\(y\\), and the regressor life expectancy, \\(x\\). In this section, we introduce one additional regressor to this model: the categorical variable income group with four categories: Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. We now want to study how fertility rate changes due to changes in life expectancy and different income levels. To do this, we use multiple regression. Observe that we now have: A numerical outcome variable \\(y\\), the fertility rate in a given country or state, and Two explanatory variables: A numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\), the life expectancy. A categorical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\), the income group. 30.1.1 Exploratory data analysis The UN member states data frame is included in the moderndive package. To keep things simple, we select() only the subset of the variables needed here, and save this data in a new data frame called UN_data_m10. Note that the variables used are different than the ones chosen in a previous walkthrough. We also set the income variable to be a factor so that its levels show up in the expected order. UN_data_m10 &lt;- un_member_states_2024 |&gt; select(country, life_expectancy_2022, fertility_rate_2022, income_group_2024)|&gt; na.omit()|&gt; rename(life_exp = life_expectancy_2022, fert_rate = fertility_rate_2022, income = income_group_2024)|&gt; mutate(income = factor(income, levels = c(&quot;Low income&quot;, &quot;Lower middle income&quot;, &quot;Upper middle income&quot;, &quot;High income&quot;))) Recall the three common steps in an exploratory data analysis we saw in Subsection 27.2.1: Inspecting a sample of raw values. Computing summary statistics. Creating data visualizations. We first look at the raw data values by either looking at UN_data_m10 using RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using the glimpse() function from the dplyr package: glimpse(UN_data_m10) Rows: 182 Columns: 4 $ country &lt;chr&gt; &quot;Afghanistan&quot;, &quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Algeria&quot;, &quot;Angola&quot;, &quot;Antigua and … $ life_exp &lt;dbl&gt; 53.6, 79.5, 78.0, 62.1, 77.8, 78.3, 76.1, 83.1, 82.3, 74.2, … $ fert_rate &lt;dbl&gt; 4.3, 1.4, 2.7, 5.0, 1.6, 1.9, 1.6, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.8, … $ income &lt;fct&gt; Low income, Upper middle income, Lower middle income, Lower … The variable country contains all the UN member states. R reads this variable as character, &lt;chr&gt;, and beyond the country identification it will not be needed for the analysis. The variables life expectancy, life_exp, and fertility rate, fert_rate, are numerical, and the variable income, income, is categorical. In R, categorical variables are called factors and the categories are factor levels. We also display a random sample of 10 rows of the 182 rows corresponding to different countries in Table 30.1. Remember due to the random nature of the sampling, you will likely end up with a different subset of 10 rows. UN_data_m10 |&gt; sample_n(size = 10) Table 30.1: A random sample of 10 out of 182 UN member states country life_exp fert_rate income Trinidad and Tobago 75.9 1.6 High income Micronesia, Federated States of 74.4 2.6 Lower middle income North Macedonia 76.8 1.4 Upper middle income Portugal 81.5 1.4 High income Madagascar 68.2 3.7 Low income Cambodia 70.7 2.3 Lower middle income Dominica 78.2 1.6 Upper middle income Peru 68.9 2.1 Upper middle income Cyprus 79.7 1.3 High income Guinea-Bissau 63.7 3.8 Low income Life expectancy, life_exp, is an estimate of how many years, on average, a person in a given country is expected to live. Fertility rate, fert_rate, is the average number of live births per woman of childbearing age in a country. As we did in our previous exploratory data analyses, we find summary statistics: UN_data_m10 |&gt; select(life_exp, fert_rate, income) |&gt; tidy_summary() column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd life_exp 182 numeric 53.6 69.4 73.67 75.2 78.4 86.4 6.86 fert_rate 182 numeric 0.9 1.6 2.49 2.0 3.2 6.6 1.16 income 25 Low income factor income 52 Lower middle income factor income 49 Upper middle income factor income 56 High income factor Recall that each row in UN_data_m10 represents a particular country or UN member state. The tidy_summary() function shows a summary for the numerical variables life expectancy (life_exp), fertility rate (fert_rate), and the categorical variable income group (income). When the variable is numerical, the tidy_summary() function provides the total number of observations in the data frame, the five-number summary, the mean, and the standard deviation. For example, the first row of our summary refers to life expectancy as life_exp. There are 182 observations for this variable, it is a numerical variable, and the first quartile, Q1, is 69.4; this means that the life expectancy of 25% of the UN member states is less than 69.4 years. When a variable in the dataset is categorical, also called a factor, the summary shows all the categories or factor levels and the number of observations for each level. For example, income group (income) is a factor with four levels: Low Income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. The summary also provides the number of states for each factor level; observe, for example, that the dataset has 56 UN member states that are considered High Income states. Furthermore, we can compute the correlation coefficient between our two numerical variables: life_exp and fert_rate. Recall from Subsection 27.2.1 that correlation coefficients only exist between numerical variables. We observe that they are “strongly negatively” correlated. UN_data_m10 |&gt; get_correlation(formula = fert_rate ~ life_exp) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.815440 We are ready to create data visualizations, the last of our exploratory data analysis. Given that the outcome variable fert_rate and explanatory variable life_exp are both numerical, we can create a scatterplot to display their relationship, as we did in Figure 27.2. But this time, we incorporate the categorical variable income by mapping this variable to the color aesthetic, thereby creating a colored scatterplot. ggplot(UN_data_m10, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate, color = income)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Life Expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate&quot;, color = &quot;Income group&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) Figure 30.1: Colored scatterplot of life expectancy and fertility rate. In the resulting Figure 30.1, observe that ggplot() assigns a default color scheme to the points and to the lines associated with the four levels of income: Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. Furthermore, the geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) layer automatically fits a different regression line for each group. We can see some interesting trends. First, observe that we get a different line for each income group. Second, the slopes for all the income groups are negative. Third, the slope for the High income group is clearly less steep than the slopes for all other three groups. So, the changes in fertility rate due to changes in life expectancy are dependent on the level of income of a given country. Fourth, observe that high-income countries have, in general, high life expectancy and low fertility rates. 30.1.2 Model with interactions We can represent the four regression lines in Figure 30.1 as a multiple regression model with interactions. Before we do this, however, we review a linear regression with only one categorical explanatory variable. Recall in Subsection 27.3.2 we fit a regression model for each country life expectancy as a function of the corresponding continent. We produce the corresponding analysis here, now using the fertility rate as the response variable and the income group as the categorical explanatory variable. We’ll use slightly different notation to what was done previously to make the model more general. A linear model with a categorical explanatory variable is called a one-factor model where factor refers to the categorical explanatory variable and the categories are also called factor levels. We represent the categories using indicator functions or dummy variables. In our UN data example, The variable income has four categories or levels: Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, and High income. The corresponding dummy variables needed are: \\[ D_1 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has low income} \\phantom{asfdasfd} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[ D_2 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has lower middle income} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[ D_3 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has high middle income}\\phantom{a} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right. \\] \\[ D_4 = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the UN member state has high income} \\phantom{asfdafd}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right.\\\\ \\] So, for example, if a given UN member state has Low income, its dummy variables are \\(D_1 = 1\\) and \\(D_2 = D_3 = D_4 = 0\\). Similarly, if another UN member state has High middle income, then its dummy variables would be \\(D_1 = D_2 = D_4 = 0\\) and \\(D_3 = 1\\). Using dummy variables, the mathematical formulation of the linear regression for our example is: \\[\\hat y = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_2 D_2 + b_3 D_3 + b_4 D_4\\] or if we want to express it in terms of the \\(i\\)th observation in our dataset, we can include the \\(i\\)th subscript: \\[\\hat y_i = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_2 D_{2i} + b_3 D_{3i} + b_4 D_{4i}\\] Recall that the coefficient \\(b_0\\) represents the intercept and the coefficients \\(b_2\\), \\(b_3\\), and \\(b_4\\) are the offsets based on the appropriate category. The dummy variables, \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\), and \\(D_4\\), take the values of zero or one depending on the corresponding category of any given country. Observe also that \\(D_1\\) does not appear in the model. The reason for this is entirely mathematical: if the model would contain an intercept and all the dummy variables, the model would be over-specified, that is, it would contain one redundant explanatory variable. The solution is to drop one of the variables. We keep the intercept because it provides flexibility when interpreting more complicated models, and we drop one of the dummy variables which, by default in R, is the first dummy variable, \\(D_1\\). This does not mean that we are losing information of the first level \\(D_1\\). If a country is part of the Low income level, \\(D_1 = 1\\), \\(D_2 = D_3 = D_4 = 0\\), so most of the terms in the regression are zero and the linear regression becomes: \\[\\hat y = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0\\] So the intercept represents the average fertility rate when the country is a Low income country. Similarly, if another country is part of the High middle income level, then \\(D_1 = D_2 = D_4 = 0\\) and \\(D_3 = 1\\) so the linear regression becomes: \\[\\hat y = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_3\\] The average fertility rate for a High middle income country is \\(b_0 + b_3\\). Observe that \\(b_3\\) is an offset for life expectancy between the baseline level and the High middle income level. The same logic applies to the model for each possible income category. We calculate the regression coefficients using the lm() function and the command coef() to retrieve the coefficients of the linear regression: one_factor_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ income, data = UN_data_m10) coef(one_factor_model) We present these results on a table with the mathematical notation used above: Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 4.28 incomeLower middle income b2 -1.30 incomeUpper middle income b3 -2.25 incomeHigh income b4 -2.65 The first level, Low income, is the “baseline” group. The average fertility rate for Low income UN member states is 4.28. Similarly, the average fertility rate for Upper middle income member states is 4.28 + -2.25 = 2.03. We are now ready to study the multiple linear regression model with interactions shown in Figure 30.1. In this figure we can identify three different effects. First, for any fixed level of life expectancy, observe that there are four different fertility rates. They represent the effect of the categorical explanatory variable, income. Second, for any given regression line, the slope represents the change in average fertility rate due to changes on life expectancy. This is the effect of the numerical explanatory variable life_exp. Third, observe that the slope of the line depends on the income level; as an illustration, observe that for High income member states the slope is less steep than for Low income member states. When the slope changes due to changes in the explanatory variable, we call this an interaction effect. The mathematical formulation of the linear regression model with two explanatory variables, one numerical and one categorical, and interactions is: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 &amp;+ b_{02}D_2 + b_{03}D_3 + b_{04}D_4 \\\\ &amp;+ b_1x \\\\ &amp;+ b_{12}xD_2 + b_{13}xD_3 + b_{14}xD_4\\end{aligned}\\] The linear regression shows how the average life expectancy is affected by the categorical variable, the numerical variable, and the interaction effects. There are eight coefficients in our model and we have separated their coefficients into three lines to highlight their different roles. The first line shows the intercept and the effects of the categorical explanatory variables. Recall that \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\), and \\(D_4\\) are the dummy variables in the model and each is equal to one or zero depending on the category of the country at hand; correspondingly, the coefficients \\(b_{02}\\), \\(b_{03}\\), and \\(b_{04}\\) are the offsets with respect to the baseline level of the intercept, \\(b_0\\). Recall that the first dummy variable has been dropped and the intercept captures this effect. The second line in the equation represents the effect of the numerical variable, \\(x\\). In our example \\(x\\) is the value of life expectancy. The coefficient \\(b_1\\) is the slope of the line and represents the change in fertility rate due to one unit change in life expectancy. The third line in the equation represents the interaction effects on the slopes. Observe that they are a combination of life expectancy, \\(x\\), and income level, \\(D_2\\), \\(D_3\\), and \\(D_4\\). What these interaction effects do is to modify the slope for different levels of income. For a Low income member state, the dummy variables are \\(D_1 = 1\\), \\(D_2 = D_3 = D_4 = 0\\) and our linear regression is: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{02}\\cdot 0 + b_{03}\\cdot 0 + b_{04}\\cdot 0 + b_1x + b_{12}x\\cdot 0 + b_{13}x\\cdot 0 + b_{14}x\\cdot 0\\\\ &amp; = b_0 + b_1x \\end{aligned}\\] Similarly, for a High income member state, the dummy variables are \\(D_1 = D_2 =D_3 = 0\\), and \\(D_4 = 1\\). We take into account the offsets for the intercept, \\(b_{04}\\), and the slope, \\(b_{14}\\), and the linear regression becomes: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} &amp;= b_0 + b_{02}\\cdot 0 + b_{03}\\cdot 0 + b_{04}\\cdot 1 + b_1 x + b_{12}x\\cdot 0 + b_{13}x\\cdot 0 + b_{14}x\\cdot 1\\\\ &amp; = b_0 + b_{04} + b_1x + b_{14}x\\\\ &amp; = (b_0 + b_{04}) + (b_1 + b_{14})\\cdot x\\end{aligned}\\] Observe how the intercept and the slope are different for a High income member state when compared to the baseline Low income member state. As an illustration, we construct this multiple linear regression for the UN member state dataset in R. We first “fit” the model using the lm() “linear model” function and then find the coefficients using the function coef(). In R, the formula used is y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2 where x1 and x2 are the variable names in the dataset and represent the main effects while x1:x2 is the interaction term. For simplicity, we can also write y ~ x1 * x2 as the * sign accounts for both, main effects and interaction effects. R would let both x1 and x2 be either explanatory or numerical, and we need to make sure the dataset format is appropriate for the regression we want to run. Here is the code for our example: # Fit regression model and get the coefficients of the model model_int &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp * income, data = UN_data_m10) coef(model_int) Table 30.2: Regression table for interaction model Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 11.918 incomeLower middle income b02 -1.504 incomeUpper middle income b03 -1.893 incomeHigh income b04 -6.580 life_exp b1 -0.118 incomeLower middle income:life_exp b12 0.013 incomeUpper middle income:life_exp b13 0.011 incomeHigh income:life_exp b14 0.072 We can match the coefficients with the values computed in Table 30.2: the fitted fertility rate \\(\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}}\\) for Low income countries is \\[\\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_1\\cdot x = 11.92 + (-0.12)\\cdot x,\\] which is the equation of the regression line in Figure 30.1 for low income countries. The regression has an intercept of 11.92 and a slope of -0.12. Since life expectancy is greater than zero for all countries, the intercept has no practical interpretation and we only need it to produce the most appropriate line. The interpretation of the slope is: for Low income countries, every additional year of life expectancy reduces the average fertility rate by 0.12 units. As discussed earlier, the intercept and slope for all the other income groups are determined by taking into account the appropriate offsets. For example, for High income countries \\(D_4 = 1\\) and all other dummy variables are equal to zero. The regression line becomes \\[\\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{fert rate}} = b_0 + b_1x + b_{04} + b_{14}x = (b_0 + b_{04} ) + (b_1+b_{14})x \\] where \\(x\\) is life expectancy, life_exp. The intercept is (Intercept) + incomeHigh income: \\[b_0 + b_{04} = 11.92 +(-6.58) = 5.34,\\] and the slope for these High income countries is life_exp + life_exp:incomeHigh income corresponding to \\[b_1 + b_{14}= -0.12 + 0.07 = -0.05.\\] For High income countries, every additional year of life expectancy reduces the average fertility rate by 0.05 units. The intercepts and slopes for other income levels are calculated similarly. Since the life expectancy for Low income countries has a steeper slope than High income countries, one additional year of life expectancy will decrease fertility rates more for the low-income group than for the high-income group. This is consistent with our observation from Figure 30.1. When the associated effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable we say that there is an interaction effect. This is the reason why the regression slopes are different for different income groups. 30.1.3 Model without interactions We can simplify the previous model by removing the interaction effects. The model still represents different income groups with different regression lines by allowing different intercepts but all the lines have the same slope: they are parallel as shown in Figure 30.2. To plot parallel slopes we use the function geom_parallel_slopes() that is included in the moderndive package. To use this function you need to load both the ggplot2 and moderndive packages. Observe how the code is identical to the one used for the model with interactions in Figure 30.1, but now the geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) layer is replaced with geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE). ggplot(UN_data_m10, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate, color = income)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Life expectancy&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility rate&quot;, color = &quot;Income group&quot;) + geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE) Figure 30.2: Parallel slopes model of fertility rate with life expectancy and income. The regression lines for each income group are shown in Figure 30.2. Observe that the lines are now parallel: they all have the same negative slope. The interpretation of this result is that the change in fertility rate due to changes in life expectancy in a given country are the same regardless the income group of this country. On the other hand, any two regression lines in Figure 30.2 have different intercepts representing the income group; in particular, observe that for any fixed level of life expectancy the fertility rate is greater for Low income and Lower middle income countries than for Upper middle income and High income countries. The mathematical formulation of the linear regression model with two explanatory variables, one numerical and one categorical, and without interactions is: \\[\\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_{02}D_2 + b_{03}D_3 + b_{04}D_4+ b_1x.\\] Observe that the dummy variables only affect the intercept now, and the slope is fully described by \\(b_1\\) for any income group. In the UN data example, a High income country, with \\(D_4 = 1\\) and the other dummy variables equal to zero, will be represented by \\[\\widehat{y} = (b_0 + b_{04})+ b_1x.\\] To find the coefficients for this regression in R, the formula used is y ~ x1 + x2 where x1 and x2 are the variable names in the dataset and represent the main effects. Observe that the term x1:x2 representing the interaction is no longer included. R would let both x1 and x2 to be either explanatory or numerical; therefore, we should always check that the variable format is appropriate for the regression we want to run. Here is the code for the UN data example: # Fit regression model: model_no_int &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp + income, data = UN_data_m10) # Get the coefficients of the model coef(model_no_int) Table 30.3: Regression table for a model without interactions Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 10.768 incomeLower middle income b02 -0.719 incomeUpper middle income b03 -1.239 incomeHigh income b04 -1.067 life_exp b1 -0.101 In this model without interactions presented in Table 30.3, the slope is the same for all the regression lines, \\(b_1 = -0.101\\). Assuming that this model is correct, for any UN member state, every additional year of life expectancy reduces the average fertility rate by 0.101 units, regardless of the income level of the member state. The intercept of the regression line for Low income member states is 10.768 while for High income member states is \\(10.768 + (-1.067) = 9.701\\). The intercepts for other income levels can be determined similarly. We compare the visualizations for both models side-by-side in Figure 30.3. Figure 30.3: Comparison of interaction and parallel slopes models. Which one is the preferred model? Looking at the scatterplot and the clusters of points in Figure 30.3, it does appear that lines with different slopes capture better the behavior of different groups of points. The lines do not appear to be parallel and the interaction model seems more appropriate. 30.1.4 Observed responses, fitted values, and residuals In this subsection, we work with the regression model with interactions. The coefficients for this model were found earlier, saved in model_int, and are displayed in Table 30.4: Table 30.4: Regression table for interaction model Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 11.918 incomeLower middle income b02 -1.504 incomeUpper middle income b03 -1.893 incomeHigh income b04 -6.580 life_exp b1 -0.118 incomeLower middle income:life_exp b12 0.013 incomeUpper middle income:life_exp b13 0.011 incomeHigh income:life_exp b14 0.072 We can use these coefficients to find the fitted values and residuals for any given observation. As an illustration, we chose two observations from the UN member states dataset, provided the values for the explanatory variables and response, as well as the fitted values and residuals: ID fert_rate income life_exp fert_rate_hat residual 1 1.3 High income 79.7 1.65 -0.35 2 5.7 Low income 62.4 4.52 1.18 The first observation is a High income country with a life expectancy of 79.74 years and an observed fertility rate equal to 1.3. The second observation is a Low income country with a life expectancy of 62.41 years and an observed fertility rate equal to 5.7 The fitted value, \\(\\hat y\\), called fert_rate_hat in the table, is the estimated value of the response determined by the regression line. This value is computed by using the values of the explanatory variables and the coefficients of the linear regression. In addition, recall the difference between the observed response value and the fitted value, \\(y - \\hat y\\), is called the residual. We illustrate this in Figure 30.4. The vertical line on the left represents the life expectancy value for the Low income country. The y-value for the large dot on the regression line that intersects the vertical line is the fitted value for fertility rate, \\(\\widehat y\\), and the y-value for the large dot above the line is the observed fertility rate, \\(y\\). The difference between these values, \\(y - \\widehat y\\), is called the residual and in this case is positive. Similarly, the vertical line on the right represents the life expectancy value for the High income country, the y-value for the large dot on the regression line is the fitted fertility rate. The observed y-value for fertility rate is below the regression line making the residual negative. Figure 30.4: Fitted values for two new countries. We can generalize the study of fitted values and residuals for all the countries in the UN_data_m10 dataset, as shown in Table 30.5. regression_points &lt;- get_regression_points(model_int) regression_points Table 30.5: Regression points (First 10 out of 182 countries) ID fert_rate income life_exp fert_rate_hat residual 1 4.3 Low income 53.6 5.56 -1.262 2 1.4 Upper middle income 79.5 1.50 -0.098 3 2.7 Lower middle income 78.0 2.16 0.544 4 5.0 Lower middle income 62.1 3.84 1.159 5 1.6 High income 77.8 1.74 -0.139 6 1.9 Upper middle income 78.3 1.62 0.278 7 1.6 Upper middle income 76.1 1.86 -0.256 8 1.6 High income 83.1 1.50 0.105 9 1.5 High income 82.3 1.53 -0.033 10 1.6 Upper middle income 74.2 2.07 -0.469 30.2 Two numerical explanatory variables We now consider regression models with two numerical explanatory variables. To illustrate this situation we explore the ISLR2 Rpackage for the first time in this book using its Credit dataset. This dataset contains simulated information for 400 customers. For the regression model we use the credit card balance (Balance) as the response variable; and the credit limit (Limit), and the income (Income) as the numerical explanatory variables. 30.2.1 Exploratory data analysis We load the Credit data frame and to ensure the type of behavior we have become accustomed to in using the tidyverse, we also convert this data frame to be a tibble using as_tibble(). We construct a new data frame credit_m10 with only the variables needed. We do this by using the select() verb as we did in Subsection 18.2.7.1 and, in addition, we save the selecting variables with different names: Balance becomes debt, Limit becomes credit_limit, and Income becomes income: library(ISLR2) credit_m10 &lt;- Credit |&gt; as_tibble() |&gt; select(debt = Balance, credit_limit = Limit, income = Income, credit_rating = Rating, age = Age) You can observe the effect of our use of select() by looking at the raw values either in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer or by using glimpse(). glimpse(credit_m10) Rows: 400 Columns: 5 $ debt &lt;dbl&gt; 333, 903, 580, 964, 331, 1151, 203, 872, 279, 1350, 1407… $ credit_limit &lt;dbl&gt; 3606, 6645, 7075, 9504, 4897, 8047, 3388, 7114, 3300, 68… $ income &lt;dbl&gt; 14.9, 106.0, 104.6, 148.9, 55.9, 80.2, 21.0, 71.4, 15.1,… $ credit_rating &lt;dbl&gt; 283, 483, 514, 681, 357, 569, 259, 512, 266, 491, 589, 1… $ age &lt;dbl&gt; 34, 82, 71, 36, 68, 77, 37, 87, 66, 41, 30, 64, 57, 49, … Furthermore, we present a random sample of five out of the 400 credit card holders in Table 30.6. As observed before, each time you run this code, a different subset of five rows is given. credit_m10 |&gt; sample_n(size = 5) Table 30.6: Random sample of 5 credit card holders debt credit_limit income credit_rating age 0 1402 27.2 128 67 1081 6922 43.7 511 49 1237 7499 58.0 560 67 379 4742 57.1 372 79 1151 8047 80.2 569 77 Note that income is in thousands of dollars while debt and credit limit are in dollars. We can also compute summary statistics using the tidy_summary() function. We only select() the columns of interest for our model as shown in Table 30.7: credit_m10 |&gt; select(debt, credit_limit, income) |&gt; tidy_summary() Table 30.7: Summary of credit data column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd debt 400 numeric 0.0 68.8 520.0 459.5 863.0 1999 459.8 credit_limit 400 numeric 855.0 3088.0 4735.6 4622.5 5872.8 13913 2308.2 income 400 numeric 10.4 21.0 45.2 33.1 57.5 187 35.2 The mean and median credit card debt are $520.0 and $459.5, respectively. The first quartile for debt is 68.8; this means that 25% of card holders had debts of $68.80 or less. Correspondingly, the mean and median credit card limit, credit_limit, are around $4,736 and $4,622, respectively. Note also that the third quartile of income is 57.5; so 75% of card holders had incomes below $57,500. We visualize the relationship of the response variable with each of the two explanatory variables using this R code. These plots are shown in Figure 30.5. ggplot(credit_m10, aes(x = credit_limit, y = debt)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Credit limit (in $)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card debt (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Debt and credit limit&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) ggplot(credit_m10, aes(x = income, y = debt)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Income (in $1000)&quot;, y = &quot;Credit card debt (in $)&quot;, title = &quot;Debt and income&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE) Figure 30.5: Relationship between credit card debt and credit limit/income. The left plot in Figure 30.5 shows a positive and linear association between credit limit and credit card debt: as credit limit increases so does credit card debt. Observe also that many customers have no credit card debt and there is a cluster of points at the credit card debt value of zero. The right plot in Figure 30.5 shows also positive and somewhat linear association between income and credit card debt, but this association seems weaker and actually appears positive only for incomes larger than $50,000. For lower income values it is not clear there is any association at all. Since variables debt, credit_limit, and income are numerical, and more importantly, the associations between the response and explanatory variables appear to be linear or close to linear, we can also calculate the correlation coefficient between any two of these variables. Recall that the correlation coefficient is appropriate if the association between the variables is linear. One way to do this is using the get_correlation() command as seen in Subsection 27.2.1, once for each explanatory variable with the response debt: credit_m10 |&gt; get_correlation(debt ~ credit_limit) credit_m10 |&gt; get_correlation(debt ~ income) Alternatively, using the select() verb and command cor() we can find all correlations simultaneously by returning a correlation matrix as shown in Table 30.8. This matrix shows the correlation coefficient for any pair of variables in the appropriate row/column combination. credit_m10 |&gt; select(debt, credit_limit, income) |&gt; cor() Table 30.8: Correlation coefficients between credit card debt, credit limit, and income debt credit_limit income debt 1.000 0.862 0.464 credit_limit 0.862 1.000 0.792 income 0.464 0.792 1.000 Let’s look at some findings presented in the correlation matrix: The diagonal values are all 1 because, based on the definition of the correlation coefficient, the correlation of a variable with itself is always 1. The correlation between debt and credit_limit is 0.862. This indicates a strong and positive linear relationship: the greater the credit limit is, the larger is the credit card debt, on average. The correlation between debt and income is 0.464. The linear relationship is positive albeit somewhat weak. In other words, higher income is only weakly associated with higher debt. Observe also that the correlation coefficient between the two explanatory variables, credit_limit and income, is 0.792. A useful property of the correlation coefficient is that it is invariant to linear transformations; this means that the correlation between two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), will be the same as the correlation between \\((a\\cdot x + b)\\) and \\(y\\) for any constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). To illustrate this, observe that the correlation coefficient between income in thousands of dollars and credit card debt was 0.464. If we now find the correlation income in dollars, by multiplying income by 1000, and credit card debt we get: credit_m10 |&gt; get_correlation(debt ~ 1000 * income) # A tibble: 1 × 1 cor &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.463656 The correlation is exactly the same. We return to our exploratory data analysis of the multiple regression. The plots in Figure 30.5 correspond to the response and each of the explanatory variables separately. In Figure 30.6 we show a 3-dimensional (3D) scatterplot representing the joint relationship of all three variables simultaneously. Each of the 400 observations in the credit_m10 data frame are marked with a blue point where The response variable \\(y\\), debt, is on the vertical axis. The regressors \\(x_1\\), income, and \\(x_2\\), credit_limit, are on the two axes that form the bottom plane. Figure 30.6: 3D scatterplot and regression plane. In addition, Figure 30.6 includes a regression plane. Recall from Subsection 27.4.2 that the linear regression with one numerical explanatory variable selects the “best-fitting” line: the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. When linear regression is performed with two numerical explanatory variables, the solution is a “best-fitting” plane: the plane that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. Visit this website to open an interactive version of this plot in your browser. 30.2.2 Multiple regression with two numerical regressors As shown in Figure 30.6, the linear regression with two numerical regressors produces the “best-fitting” plane. We start with a model with no interactions for the two numerical explanatory variables income and credit_limit. In R we consider a model fit with a formula of the form y ~ x1 + x2. We retrieve the regression coefficients using the lm() function and the command coef() to get the coefficients of the linear regression. The regression coefficients are shown in what follows. debt_model &lt;- lm(debt ~ credit_limit + income, data = credit_m10) coef(debt_model) We present these results in a table with the mathematical notation used above: Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 -385.179 credit_limit b1 0.264 income b2 -7.663 We determine the linear regression coefficients using lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data) where x1 and x2 are the two numerical explanatory variables used. We extract the coefficients from the output using the coef() command. Let’s interpret the coefficients. The intercept value is -$385.179. If the range of values that the regressors could take include a credit_limit of $0 and an income of $0, the intercept would represent the average credit card debt for an individual with those levels of credit_limit and income. This is not the case in our data and the intercept has no practical interpretation; it is mainly used to determine where the plane should cut the \\(y\\)-intercept to produce the smallest sum of squared residuals. Each slope in a multiple linear regression is considered a partial slope and represents the marginal or additional contribution of a regressor when it is added to a model that already contains other regressors. This partial slope is typically different than the slope we may find in a simple linear regression for the same regressor. The reason is that, typically, regressors are correlated, so when one regressor is part of a model, indirectly it’s also explaining part of the other regressor. When the second regressor is added to the model, it helps explain only changes in the response that were not already accounted for by the first regressor. For example, the slope for credit_limit is $0.264. Keeping income fixed to some value, for an additional increase of credit limit by one dollar the credit debt increases, on average, by $0.264. Similarly, the slope of income is -$7.663. Keeping credit_limit fixed to some level, for a one unit increase of income ($1000 in actual income), there is an associated decrease of $7.66 in credit card debt, on average. Putting these results together, the equation of the regression plane that gives us fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) = \\(\\widehat{\\text{debt}}\\) is: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + b_2 \\cdot x_2\\\\ &amp;= -385.179 + 0.263 \\cdot x_1 - 7.663 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(x_1\\) represents credit limit and \\(x_2\\) income. To illustrate the role of partial slopes further, observe that the right plot in Figure 30.5 shows the relationship between debt and income in isolation, a positive relationship, so the slope of income is positive. We can determine the value of this slope by constructing a simple linear regression using income as the only regressor: # Fit regression model and get the coefficients of the model simple_model &lt;- lm(debt ~ income, data = credit_m10) coef(simple_model) Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0’ 246.51 income b2’ 6.05 The regression line is given by the following with the coefficients denoted using the prime (\\(&#39;\\)) designation since they are different values than what we saw previously \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= b_0&#39; + b_2&#39; \\cdot x_2 = 246.515 + 6.048 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(x_2\\) is income. By contrast, when credit_limit and income are considered jointly to explain changes in debt, the equation for the multiple linear regression was: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_1 + b_2 \\cdot x_2\\\\ &amp;= -385.179 + 0.263 \\cdot x_1 - 7.663 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] So the slope for income in a simple linear regression is 6.048, and the slope for income in a multiple linear regression is \\(-7.663\\). As surprising as these results may appear at first, they are perfectly valid and consistent as the slope of a simple linear regression has a different role than the partial slope of a multiple linear regression. The latter is the additional effect of income on debt when credit_limit has already been taken into account. 30.2.3 Observed/fitted values and residuals As shown in Subsection 30.1.4 for the UN member states example, we find the fitted values and residuals for our credit card debt regression model. The fitted values for the credit card debt (\\(\\widehat{\\text{debt}}\\)) are computed using the equation for the regression plane: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y} = \\widehat{\\text{debt}} &amp;= -385.179 + 0.263 \\cdot x_1 - 7.663 \\cdot x_2 \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(x_1\\) is credit_limit and \\(x_2\\) is income. The residuals are the difference between the observed credit card debt and the fitted credit card debt, \\(y - \\widehat y\\), for each observation in the data set. In R, we find the fitted values, debt_hat, and residuals, residual, using the get_regression_points() function. In Table 30.9 we present the first 10 rows of output. Remember that the coordinates of each of the points in our 3D scatterplot in Figure 30.6 can be found in the income, credit_limit, and debt columns. get_regression_points(debt_model) Table 30.9: Regression points (First 10 credit card holders out of 400) ID debt credit_limit income debt_hat residual 1 333 3606 14.9 454 -120.8 2 903 6645 106.0 559 344.3 3 580 7075 104.6 683 -103.4 4 964 9504 148.9 986 -21.7 5 331 4897 55.9 481 -150.0 6 1151 8047 80.2 1127 23.6 7 203 3388 21.0 349 -146.4 8 872 7114 71.4 948 -76.0 9 279 3300 15.1 371 -92.2 10 1350 6819 71.1 873 477.3 30.3 Conclusion Congratulations! We’ve completed our introduction to modeling and are ready to shift our attention to statistical inference. Statistical inference is the science of inferring about some unknown quantity using sampling. The most well-known examples of sampling in practice involve polls. Because asking an entire population about their opinions would be a long and arduous task, pollsters often take a smaller sample that is hopefully representative of the population. Based on the results of this sample, pollsters hope to make claims about the entire population. Once we’ve covered sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing, we’ll revisit the regression models we studied last module and this one to study inference for regression. So far, we’ve only studied the estimate column of all our regression tables. The next four chapters focus on what the remaining columns mean: the standard error (std_error), the test statistic, the p_value, and the lower and upper bounds of confidence intervals (lower_ci and upper_ci). Furthermore, when covering inference for regressino, we’ll revisit the concept of residuals \\(y - \\widehat{y}\\) and discuss their importance when interpreting the results of a regression model. We’ll perform what is known as a residual analysis of the residual variable of all get_regression_points() outputs. Residual analyses allow you to verify what are known as the conditions for inference for regression. On to sampling! 30.4 References James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., &amp; Tibshirani, R. (2017).

You can think of a population as a collection of persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a sample. The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling from a population. Because it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical technique. In U.S. presidential elections, for example, there are millions of potential voters, and it would be highly impractical to survey all of them. Instead, opinion poll samples of 1,000–2,000 people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country. Likewise, manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of carbonated drink—this is a lot more effective than checking all of the cans! From the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. We’ve been using the word statistics in a more general sense up until now, but it’s worth paying attention to a more specific definition: Formally speaking, a statistic is a number that represents a property of the sample. For example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic. The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter. A parameter is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter. One of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain the characteristics of the population in order to be a representative sample. In inferential statistics, we are interested in both the sample statistic and the population parameter. 32.2 Samples As mentioned earlier, gathering information about an entire population often costs too much—or is virtually impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. Ideally, a sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing. Most researchers use various methods of random sampling in an attempt to achieve this goal. There are several different methods of random sampling. In each form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a simple random sample. Any group of \\(n\\) individuals is equally likely to be chosen as any other group of \\(n\\) individuals if the simple random sampling technique is used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected. When you analyze data, it is important to be aware of sampling errors and nonsampling errors. The actual process of sampling inherently causes sampling errors—this is the kind of error we try to minimize rather than entirely avoid. For example, if a sample is not large enough, we try to collect a larger sample—however, as we’ve already established, the whole point of sampling is because we don’t want to collect all of the available data, so there’s always going to be some kind of gap. Nonetheless, as a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error. Factors not related to the sampling process cause nonsampling errors. A defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error. This kind of error is a bigger deal, and we need to get rid of it as much as possible In statistics, a sampling bias is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance of being chosen). When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population that is being studied. 32.2.1 Variation in Samples Variation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers regularly run tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range. Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and your accuracy. To reiterate, two or more samples from the same population, taken randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep each night. Doreen’s sample will be different from Jung’s sample, but neither would necessarily be wrong! Can you think of what would lead these samples to be different from each other? 32.2.2 Sample Sizes If Doreen and Jung took larger samples (i.e. the number of data values is increased), their sample results (the average amount of time a student sleeps) might be closer to the actual population average. But still, their samples would be, in all likelihood, different from each other. Still, the size of a sample (that is, the number of observations) is important. Samples of only a few hundred observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200 to 1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. However, be aware that many large samples are biased. For example, call-in surveys are invariably biased, because people choose to respond or not. 32.3 Probability It is often necessary to “guess” about the outcome of an event in order to make a decision. Politicians study polls to guess their likelihood of winning an election. Teachers choose a particular course of study based on what they think students can comprehend. Doctors choose the treatments needed for various diseases based on their assessment of likely results. You may have visited a casino where people play games chosen because of the belief that the likelihood of winning is good. Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity. An experiment is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions. If the result is not predetermined, then the experiment is said to be a chance experiment. Flipping one fair coin twice is an example of an experiment. A result of an experiment is called an outcome. The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. The uppercase letter \\(S\\) is used to denote the sample space. For example, if you flip one fair coin, \\(S = \\{H, T\\}\\) where \\(H\\) = heads and \\(T\\) = tails are the outcomes. An event is any combination of outcomes. Upper case letters like \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) represent events. For example, if the experiment is to flip one fair coin, event \\(A\\) might be getting at most one head. The probability of an event \\(A\\) is written \\(P(A)\\). The probability of any outcome is the long-term relative frequency of that outcome. Probabilities are between zero and one, inclusive (that is, zero and one and all numbers between these values). \\(P(A) = 0\\) means the event \\(A\\) can never happen. \\(P(A) = 1\\) means the event \\(A\\) always happens. \\(P(A) = 0.5\\) means the event \\(A\\) is equally likely to occur or not to occur. For example, if you flip one fair coin repeatedly (from 20 to 2,000 to 20,000 times) the relative frequency of heads approaches 0.5 (the probability of heads). To calculate the probability of an event \\(A\\), count the number of outcomes that lead to event \\(A\\) and divide by the total number of outcomes in the sample space. For example, if you toss a fair dime and a fair nickel, the sample space is \\(\\{HH, TH, HT, TT\\}\\) where \\(T\\) = tails and \\(H\\) = heads. The sample space has four outcomes; if we define \\(A\\) as getting one head, there there are two outcomes that meet this condition: \\(\\{HT, TH\\}\\). So \\(P(A) = 2/4 = 0.5\\). Roll2dice, by Niyumard, is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0 Let’s look at a slightly more complex example: rolling 2 six-sided dice. As seen in the image above, there are 36 different outcomes to rolling two dice. However, those outcomes are distributed in a way that some events are more likely than others. Let’s think about 11 events that are tied to getting a particular number, from two to twelve. As the image demonstrates, 6 out of those 36 outcomes add up to 7. However, only 5 out of 36 outcomes add up to either 5 or 8, and once we get out to 2 or 12, there’s only a 1 in 36 chance of getting what you want. So, there’s a much higher probability for the event of rolling a 7 than for the event of rolling a 12. However, there’s an important detail in here. If you were to roll two six-sided dice 36 times, you would not be surprised if your observed results did not match the theoretical probabilities shown above. If you were to roll two dice a very large number of times, you would expect that approximately 6/36 (1/6) of the rolls would result in an outcome of 7. You would probably not expect exactly 6/36, though. The long-term relative frequency of obtaining this result would approach the theoretical probability of 6/36 as the number of repetitions grows larger and larger. This important characteristic of probability experiments is known as the Law of Large Numbers which states that as the number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the relative frequency obtained in the experiment tends to become closer and closer to the theoretical probability. Even though the outcomes do not happen according to any set pattern or order, overall, the long-term observed relative frequency will approach the theoretical probability. 32.4 Expected Values and the Law of Large Numbers The expected value is often referred to as the “long-term” average or mean. This means that over the long term of doing an experiment over and over, you would expect this average. You toss a coin and record the result. What is the probability that the result is heads? If you flip a coin two times, does probability tell you that these flips will result in one heads and one tail? Not necessarily! You could conceivably toss a fair coin ten times and record nine heads. As I suggested earlier, probability does not describe the short-term results of an experiment. Instead, it gives information about what can be expected in the long term. To demonstrate this, Karl Pearson once tossed a fair coin 24,000 times! He recorded the results of each toss, obtaining heads 12,012 times—only twelve off from what you would expect. In his experiment, Pearson illustrated the Law of Large Numbers. Again, the Law of Large Numbers states that, as the number of trials in a probability experiment increases, the difference between the theoretical probability of an event and the relative frequency approaches zero (the theoretical probability and the relative frequency get closer and closer together). When evaluating the long-term results of statistical experiments, we often want to know the “average” outcome. This “long-term average” is known as the mean or expected value of the experiment. In other words, after conducting many trials of an experiment, you would expect this average value. 32.5 Probability and Sampling In most ways, sampling from a population is not like flipping a coin, but there are some core concepts that overlap in a way that’s helpful in data science: First, like flipping a coin, an observation of a variable in a sample has the potential to take on a range of different values. For a coin, this is pretty straightforward: heads or tails. For an observation, it depends on what you’re measuring. The possible range for the beats per minute when measuring the tempo of a Spotify song is going to be different than possible range for the beats per minute when measuring the a patient’s resting heartrate in a doctor’s office. In all cases, though, there’s a range of possible values that a given observation might take on for that variable. Second, like flipping a coin, we expect that different observations are going to take on different values for that variable. Unless you have a trick coin, you aren’t going to get heads every single time. Likewise, not every patient at a doctor’s office is going to have the same resting heartrate. In my family, we tend to have abnormally low resting heartrates, and even though my Apple Watch gets really concerned about this, my physician isn’t worried. Third, the Law of Large Numbers applies equally well to both. The more that we flip a coin, the closer the relative frequency of getting a heads gets to .5—the theoretical probability of that event. Likewise, the more times we measure patients’ resting heartrate, the closer the average resting heartrate in our sample is going to be to the average resting heartrate across all of humanity. In that last comparison, you might feel like the comparison doesn’t line up as well as the two previous comparisons. It’s easy to puzzle out the “theoretical probability” for flipping a coin and to compare it to a relative frequency, but what’s the “theoretical probability” for a resting heartrate? Or any other variable, for that matter? We’ll tackle that in the next section! 32.6 Probability and the Normal Distribution With examples like coins and dice, it’s quite easy to puzzle out the theoretical probability for given outcomes and events and work the math out from there. However, other variables are a lot trickier—there’s nothing in our DNA that indicates the probability of a patient’s resting heartrate being a particular number, and there’s nothing in the physics of sound that tells us what the probability of a song on Spotify having a particular tempo is. So, we need some way of figuring out what that probability is on our own. Let’s look back at our example of rolling 2 six-sided dice. Even if we weren’t mathematically sophisticated enough to figure out the probability of a particular result based on “how dice work,” there’s another way that we could estimate the probability of rolling any given number: rolling 2 dice a heck of a bunch of times and recording our results. Remember the Law of Large Numbers? That tells us that the more we observe (sample) something, the more our pattern of observations resembles the theoretical probabilities associated with a phenomenon. So, if we rolled 2 dice hundreds of times, we’d start to realize that rolls cluster around 7 and get less likely as we get closer to either end of the possible range of rolls. That would be enough data for us to start to make assumptions about the probability of any given result, and those assumptions would be pretty darn close to what the raw mathematics would have told us in the first place. What’s stopping us from doing the same thing with resting heartrates? Or tempos of songs on Spotify? Well, nothing really! In fact, that’s what researchers do all the time to establish the range of possible outcomes and the probability of getting a possible outcome within that range. (Truth be told, there’s a bit more statistical theory at the heart of this that I’m skipping over, but we’re skipping straight to the practical stuff with a warning that if you go further with data science, it’s important to better understand the theory that we’re skipping over.) In fact, there’s a pretty good chance that if you observed (that is, sampled) a particular variable enough times, you’d end up with a pattern that’s pretty similar to what we see for dice rolls. There would be a peak right around the mean, with a gradual descent on either side. This is often called a bell curve, but we’re going to refer to it differently—as a normal distribution. Standard deviation diagram, by M. W. Toews, is licensed under CC BY 2.5 A normal distribution looks like the image above. It peaks at the mean—that is, the mean value of the variable is the outcome that we’d expect to see most often. Then, like our dice, the probability of outcomes gets lower and lower as we get further and further away from the mean. Keep in mind that the actual value of the mean doesn’t matter—we would expect the mean of different variables to be different! A normal distribution is less about the exact numbers and more about the patterns associated with those numbers. In fact, that’s also nicely demonstrated with some of the other things that appear in that image. In a normal distribution, there is a specific pattern for how probabilities decrease as outcomes get further away from the mean. The \\(σ\\) symbol above is the a lower-case Greek letter sigma, and in statistics it refers to the standard deviation—a concept that we covered a few weeks ago and that is worth reviewing if it’s feeling fuzzy! In short, 68.2% of the observations of a variable following the patterns of a normal distribution will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. That is if you subtract the standard deviation for a variable from the mean for that variable, 34.1% of your observations ought to be higher than that number but lower than the mean. Then, if you add the standard deviation for a variable to the mean for that variable, an additional 34.1% of your observations ought to be lower than that number but higher than the mean. In turn, all of this means that there is a 68.2% probability that an observation will fall between the numbers that you’ve just calculated. If you go out 2 standard deviations from the mean, your chances get even higher that an observation falls within that range. You can see from the image that it’s an additional 13.6% in each direction. Multiply that by two and add it to the 68.2% from above, and you’ll get about 95%. There’s a 95% probability that an observation falls within that range. The normal distribution is important to understand because so much of statistics relies on these concepts. In fact, it’s customary for data scientists—and researchers of all kinds—to assume that a variable is normally distributed when we’re working with it. However, it’s also important to understand that as common as a normal distribution is for all kinds of variables, it’s not always how variables work. Just like we glossed over some theory earlier, we’re largely going to gloss over the importance of testing variables for normal distributions and alternate approaches to statistical analyses when the assumption of a normal distribution doesn’t hold up. That doesn’t mean these things aren’t important—they’re incredibly important! It’s just another thing that we don’t have time to cover because data science involves so dang much. Once again, if you continue down a data science path, it’s very important to dig deeper into what I’m glossing over here. 32.7 Conclusion A lot of this reading is dedicated to setting the groundwork for future concepts, so if it’s not obvious how things fit together right now, that’s okay! What you ought to take away from this reading for now is: 1) that data scientists nearly always work with samples instead of populations, 2) that larger, representative samples better approximate populations than smaller, non-representative samples, and 3) with a larger sample (one with more observations), we can get a pretty good feel for what the probability of a given result is. Furthermore, like some other recent readings, our walkthrough for this week is going to cover sampling again, though not necessarily all of the details that we’ve covered here. This is less about being redundant as it is about covering an important concept multiple times from multiple angles.

For details refer to Section 18.4. The packages moderndive and infer contain functions and data frames that will be used in this chapter. 33.1 First activity: red balls Take a look at the bowl in Figure 33.1. It has red and white balls of equal size. The balls have been mixed beforehand, and there does not seem to be any particular pattern for the location of red and white balls inside the bowl. Figure 33.1: A bowl with red and white balls. 33.1.1 The proportion of red balls in the bowl Let’s say that we’re interested in finding the proportion of red balls in the bowl. To find this proportion, we could count the number of red balls and divide this number by the total number of balls. The bowl seen in Figure 33.1 is represented virtually by the data frame bowl included in the moderndive package. The first ten rows are shown here for illustration purposes: bowl # A tibble: 2,400 × 2 ball_ID color &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 white 2 2 white 3 3 white 4 4 red 5 5 white 6 6 white 7 7 red 8 8 white 9 9 red 10 10 white # ℹ 2,390 more rows The bowl has 2400 rows representing the 2400 balls in the bowl shown in Figure 33.1. You can view and scroll through the entire contents of the bowl in RStudio’s data viewer by running View(bowl). The first variable ball_ID is used as an identification variable as discussed in Subsection 6.4.4; none of the balls in the actual bowl are marked with numbers. The second variable color indicates whether a particular virtual ball is red or white. We can compute the proportion of red balls in the bowl using the dplyr data-wrangling verbs presented in Chapter 18.2. A few steps are needed in order to determine this proportion. Let’s look at these these steps separately to remind you how they work but later introduce all the steps together and simplify some of the code. First, for each of the balls, we identify if it is red or not using a test for equality with the logical operator ==. We do this by using the mutate() function from Section 18.2.3 that allows us to create a new Boolean variable called is_red. bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 2,400 × 3 ball_ID color is_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; 1 1 white FALSE 2 2 white FALSE 3 3 white FALSE 4 4 red TRUE 5 5 white FALSE 6 6 white FALSE 7 7 red TRUE 8 8 white FALSE 9 9 red TRUE 10 10 white FALSE # ℹ 2,390 more rows The variable is_red returns the Boolean (that is, logical) value TRUE for each row where color == \"red\" and FALSE for every row where color is not equal to \"red\". Since R treats TRUE like the number 1 and FALSE like the number 0, accounting for TRUEs and FALSEs is equivalent to working with 1’s and 0’s. In particular, adding all the 1’s and 0’s is equivalent to counting how many red balls are in the bowl. Let’s compute this using the sum() function inside the summarize() function. Recall from Section 24.2 that summarize() takes a data frame with many rows and returns a data frame with a single row containing summary statistics such as the sum(): bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) |&gt; summarize(num_red = sum(is_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 num_red &lt;int&gt; 1 900 The sum() has added all the 1’s and 0’s and has effectively counted the number of red balls. There are 900 red balls in the bowl. Since the bowl contains 2400 balls, the proportion of red balls is 900/2400 = 0.375. We could ask R to find the proportion directly by replacing sum() with the mean() function inside summarize(). The average of 1’s and 0’s is precisely the proportion of red balls in the bowl: bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = (color == &quot;red&quot;)) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(is_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 prop_red &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375 This code works well but can be simplified once more. Instead of creating a new Boolean variable is_red before finding the proportion, we could write both steps simultaneously in a single line of code: bowl |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 prop_red &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375 In the rest of this chapter, we’ll be using this kind of calculation frequently. 33.1.2 Manual sampling In the previous subsection, we were able to find the proportion of red balls in the bowl using R only because we had the information of the entire bowl as a data frame. Otherwise, we would have to retrieve this manually. If the bowl contained a large number of balls, this could be a long and tedious process. How long do you think it would take to do this manually if the bowl had tens of thousands of balls? Or millions? Or even more? In real-life situations, we are often interested in finding the proportion of a very large number of objects (or subjects), and performing an exhaustive count could be tedious, costly, impractical, or even impossible. Because of these limitations, we typically do not perform exhaustive counts. Rather, for this balls example, we randomly select a sample of balls from the bowl, find the proportion of red balls in this sample, and use this proportion to (hopefully) learn more about the proportion of red balls in the entire bowl. One sample We could do this by inserting a shovel into the bowl as seen in Figure 33.2 and collecting \\(5 \\cdot 10 = 50\\) balls as shown in Figure 33.3. The set of balls retrieved is called a sample. Figure 33.2: Inserting a shovel into the bowl. Figure 33.3: Taking a sample of 50 balls from the bowl. Since 17 of the balls are red, the proportion of red balls in the sample is 17/50 = 0.34 or 34%. Compare this to the proportion of red balls in the entire bowl, 0.375, that we found in Subsection 33.1.1. The proportion from the sample seems actually pretty good, and it did not take much time or energy to get. But, was this approximate proportion just a lucky outcome? Could we be this lucky the next time we take a sample from the bowl? Let’s imagine that we take more samples from the bowl and calculate the proportions of red balls in those samples. Thirty-three samples Each time we take another sample, we do the following: return the 50 balls used earlier back into the bowl and mix the contents of the bowl to ensure that each new sample is not influenced by the previous sample; then, take a new sample with the shovel and determine a new proportion of red balls. Figure 33.4: Repeating sampling activity. If we did this many times, we would observe that different samples may produce different proportions of red balls. A proportion of red balls from a sample is called a sample proportion. A group of 33 students performed this activity previously and drew a histogram using blocks to represent sample proportions of red balls. Figure 33.5 shows students working on the histogram with two blocks drawn already representing the first two sample proportions found and the third about to be added. Figure 33.5: Students drawing a histogram of sample proportions. Recall from Section 21.5 that histograms help us visualize the distribution of a numerical variable. In particular, where the center of the values falls and how the values vary. A histogram of the first 10 sample proportions can be seen in Figure 33.6. Figure 33.6: Hand-drawn histogram of 10 sample proportions. By looking at the histogram, we can see that the lowest proportion of red balls was between 0.20 and 0.25 while the highest was between 0.45 and 0.5. More importantly, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 0.30 and 0.35. This real-life version of the activity has results stored in the tactile_prop_red data frame included in the moderndive package. Here are the first 10 rows: tactile_prop_red # A tibble: 33 × 4 group replicate red_balls prop_red &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Ilyas, Yohan 1 21 0.42 2 Morgan, Terrance 2 17 0.34 3 Martin, Thomas 3 21 0.42 4 Clark, Frank 4 21 0.42 5 Riddhi, Karina 5 18 0.36 6 Andrew, Tyler 6 19 0.38 7 Julia 7 19 0.38 8 Rachel, Lauren 8 11 0.22 9 Daniel, Caroline 9 15 0.3 10 Josh, Maeve 10 17 0.34 # ℹ 23 more rows Notice that for each student group, the data frame provides their names, the number of red_balls observed in the sample, and the calculated proportion of red balls in the sample, prop_red. We also have a replicate variable counting off each of the 33 groups. The name replicate indicates that each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated (in other words “repeated”) activity. Using the R data visualization techniques introduced earlier in the semester, we can construct the histogram for all 33 sample proportions as shown in Figure 33.7. Recall that each student has a sample of 50 balls using the same procedure and has calculated the proportion of red balls in each sample. The histogram is built using only those sample proportions. We do not need the individual information of each student or the number of red balls found. We constructed the histogram using ggplot() with geom_histogram(). To align the bins in the computerized histogram version so it matches the hand-drawn histogram shown in Figure 33.6, this code uses the arguments boundary = 0.4 and binwidth = 0.05. The former indicates that we want a binning scheme, so that one of the bins’ boundaries is at 0.4; the latter fixes the width of the bin to 0.05 units. ggplot(tactile_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of red balls in each sample&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 33 proportions&quot;) Figure 33.7: The distribution of sample proportions based on 33 random samples of size 50. When studying the histogram, we can see that some proportions are lower than 25% and others are greater than 45%, but most of the sample proportions are between 30% and 45%. We can also use this activity to introduce some statistical terminology. The process of taking repeated samples of 50 balls and finding the corresponding sample proportions is called sampling. Since we returned the observed balls to the bowl before getting another sample, we say that we performed sampling with replacement and because we mixed the balls before taking a new sample, the samples were randomly drawn and are called random samples. As shown in Figure 33.7, different random samples produce different sample proportions. This phenomenon is called sampling variation. Furthermore, the histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of sample proportions; it describes the sample proportions determined and how often they appear. The distribution of all possible sample proportions that can be found from random samples is called, appropriately, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. The sampling distribution is central to the ideas we develop in this chapter. 33.1.3 Virtual sampling In the previous Subsection 33.1.2, we imagined a tactile sampling activity: students took physical samples using a real shovel from a bowl with white and red balls by hand. Let’s now extend the entire process using simulations on a computer, a sort of virtual sampling activity. The use of simulations permits us to study not only 33 random samples but thousands, tens of thousands, or even more samples. When a large number of random samples is retrieved, we can gain a better understanding of the sampling distribution and the sampling variation of sample proportions. In addition, we are not limited by samples of 50 balls, as we can simulate sampling with any desired sample size. We’ll go through all of this in this subsection, beginning by reproducing our manual activity. One virtual sample Recall that the bowl seen in Figure 33.1 is represented by the data frame bowl included in the moderndive package. The virtual analog to the 50-ball shovel seen in Figure 33.2 can be achieved using the rep_slice_sample() function included in the moderndive package. This function allows us to take repeated (or replicated) random samples of size n. Let’s start by taking a single sample of 50 balls. Before running the code, though, remember that sampling is a random, variable process. As you run the code in the book, you may get different results than the book. In most cases, that won’t be an issue, though you should use your critical thinking and statistical reasoning to look out for potential problems! virtual_shovel &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50) virtual_shovel # A tibble: 50 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ball_ID color &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 1970 white 2 1 842 red 3 1 2287 white 4 1 599 white 5 1 108 white 6 1 846 red 7 1 390 red 8 1 344 white 9 1 910 white 10 1 1485 white # ℹ 40 more rows Notice that virtual_shovel has 50, rows corresponding to our virtual sample of size 50. The ball_ID variable identifies which of the 2400 balls from bowl are included in our sample of 50 balls while color denotes whether its white or red. The replicate variable is equal to 1 for all 50 rows because we have decided to take only one sample right now. Later on, we take more samples, and replicate will take more values. Let’s compute the proportion of red balls in our virtual sample. The code we use is similar to the one used for finding the proportion of red balls in the entire bowl in Subsection 33.1.1: virtual_shovel |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 Based on this random sample, 24% of the virtual_shovel’s 50 balls were red! Remember, though, that because sampling is random, you may well get a different result. Let’s proceed finding the sample proportion for more random samples. Thirty-three virtual samples In Section 33.1, students got 33 samples and sample proportions. They repeated/replicated the sampling process 33 times. Let’s do this virtually by again using the function rep_slice_sample() and this time adding the reps = 33 argument as we want to retrieve 33 random samples. We’ll save these samples in the data frame virtual_samples, as shown, and then provide a preview of its first 10 rows. If you want to inspect the entire virtual_samples data frame, use RStudio’s data viewer by running View(virtual_samples). virtual_samples &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 33) virtual_samples # A tibble: 1,650 × 3 # Groups: replicate [33] replicate ball_ID color &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 1970 white 2 1 842 red 3 1 2287 white 4 1 599 white 5 1 108 white 6 1 846 red 7 1 390 red 8 1 344 white 9 1 910 white 10 1 1485 white # ℹ 1,640 more rows Observe in the data viewer that the first 50 rows of replicate are equal to 1, the next 50 rows of replicate are equal to 2, and so on. The first 50 rows correspond to the first sample of 50 balls while the next 50 rows correspond to the second sample of 50 balls. This pattern continues for all reps = 33 replicates, and thus virtual_samples has 33 \\(\\cdot\\) 50 = 1650 rows. Using virtual_samples, we can find the proportion of red balls for each replicate. Let’s use the same dplyr verbs as before. In particular, we add group_by() of the replicate variable. Recall from Section 24.3 that by assigning the grouping variable “meta-data” before summarize(), we perform the calculations needed for each replicate separately. The other line of code, as explained in the case of one sample, calculates the sample proportion of red balls. Here’s a preview of my first 10 rows: virtual_prop_red &lt;- virtual_samples |&gt; group_by(replicate) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_red # A tibble: 33 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 2 2 0.46 3 3 0.38 4 4 0.36 5 5 0.38 6 6 0.3 7 7 0.42 8 8 0.42 9 9 0.32 10 10 0.48 # ℹ 23 more rows Technically, the function rep_slice_sample() already groups the data by replicate, so it is not 100% necessary to include group_by() in the code. Moreover, using dplyr pipes in R we could simplify the work and write everything at once: using rep_slice_sample(), we have 33 replicates (each being a random sample of 50 balls) and using summarize() with mean() on the Boolean values, we determine the proportion of red balls for each sample. Let’s store these proportions in the data frame virtual_prop_red. I’ll print my first 10 sample proportions (for the first 10 samples) as an illustration: virtual_prop_red &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 33) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_red # A tibble: 33 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 2 2 0.46 3 3 0.38 4 4 0.36 5 5 0.38 6 6 0.3 7 7 0.42 8 8 0.42 9 9 0.32 10 10 0.48 # ℹ 23 more rows As was the case in the tactile activity, there is sampling variation in the resulting 33 proportions from the virtual samples. (In fact, you should see differences between my variation and your variation!) Let’s construct a histogram with these sample proportions as shown in Figure 33.8. The histogram helps us visualize the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. Observe again the histogram was constructed using ggplot(), geom_histogram(), and including the arguments binwidth = 0.05 and boundary = 0.4. ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample proportion&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 33 sample proportions&quot;) Figure 33.8: The distribution of 33 proportions based on 33 virtual samples of size 50. When observing the histogram, we can see that some proportions are lower than 25% and others are greater than 45%. Also, the sample proportions observed more frequently are between 35% and 40% (for 11 out of 33 samples). We found similar results when sampling was done by hand in Subsection 33.1.2, and that histogram was presented in Figure 33.7. You can see both histograms side by side in Figure 33.9 for an easy comparison. Note that they are somewhat similar in their center and variation, although not identical. The differences are also due to sampling variation. Figure 33.9: The sampling distribution of the sample proportion and sampling variation: showing a histogram for virtual sample proportions (left) and another histogram for tactile sample proportions (right). One thousand virtual samples It was helpful to observe how sampling variation affects sample proportions in 33 samples. It was also interesting to note that while the 33 virtual samples provide different sample proportions than the 33 physical samples, the overall patterns were fairly similar. Because the samples were taken at random in both cases, any other set of 33 samples, virtual or physical, would provide a different set of sample proportions due to sampling variation, but the overall patterns would still be similar. Still, 33 samples are not enough to fully understand these patterns. This is why we’re now going to study the sampling distribution and the effects of sampling variation with 1000 random samples. Trying to do this manually could be impractical, but getting virtual samples can be done quickly and efficiently. Additionally, we have already developed the tools for this. We’ll repeat the steps performed earlier using the rep_slice_sample() function with a sample size set to be 50. This time, however, let’s set the number of replicates (reps) to 1000, and use summarize() and mean() again on the Boolean values to calculate the sample proportions. We’ll compute virtual_prop_red with the count of red balls and the corresponding sample proportion for all 1000 random samples. The proportions for my first 10 samples are shown: virtual_prop_red &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_red # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate prop_red &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 2 2 0.46 3 3 0.38 4 4 0.36 5 5 0.38 6 6 0.3 7 7 0.42 8 8 0.42 9 9 0.32 10 10 0.48 # ℹ 990 more rows As done previously, a histogram for these 1000 sample proportions is given in Figure 33.10. ggplot(virtual_prop_red, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample proportion&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 1000 sample proportions&quot;) Figure 33.10: The distribution of 1000 proportions based on 1000 random samples of size 50. The sample proportions represented by the histogram could be as low as 15% or as high as 60%, but those extreme proportions are rare. The most frequent proportions determined are those between 35% and 40%. Please read the “Normal distribution” section of (Appendix A online) for a brief discussion of this distribution and its properties. Different sample sizes Another advantage of using simulations is that we can also study how the sampling distribution of the sample proportion changes if we find the sample proportions from samples smaller than or larger than 50 balls. We do need to be careful to not mix results, though: we build the sampling distribution using sample proportions from samples of the same size, but the size chosen does not have to be 50 balls. We must first decide the sample size we want to use, and then take samples using that size. As an illustration, we can perform the sampling activity three times, for each activity using a different sample size, think of having three shovels of sizes 25, 50, and 100 as shown in Figure 33.11. Of course, we do this virtually: with each shovel size we gather many random samples, calculate the corresponding sample proportions, and plot those proportions in a histogram. Therefore we create three histograms, each one describing the sampling distribution for sample proportions from samples of size 25, 50, and 100, respectively. As we show later in this subsection, the size of the sample has a direct effect on the sampling distribution and the magnitude of its sampling variation. Figure 33.11: Three shovels to extract three different sample sizes. We follow the same process performed previously: we generate 1000 samples, find the sample proportions, and use them to draw a histogram. We follow this process three different times, setting the size argument in the code equal to 25, 50, and 100, respectively. We run each of the following code segments individually and then compare the resulting histograms. # Segment 1: sample size = 25 ------------------------------ # 1.a) Compute sample proportions for 1000 samples, each sample of size 25 virtual_prop_red_25 &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 25, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # 1.b) Plot a histogram to represent the distribution of the sample proportions ggplot(virtual_prop_red_25, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 25 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;25&quot;) # Segment 2: sample size = 50 ------------------------------ # 2.a) Compute sample proportions for 1000 samples, each sample of size 50 virtual_prop_red_50 &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # 2.b) Plot a histogram to represent the distribution of the sample proportions ggplot(virtual_prop_red_50, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 50 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;50&quot;) # Segment 3: sample size = 100 ------------------------------ # 2.a) Compute sample proportions for 1000 samples, each sample of size 100 virtual_prop_red_100 &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 100, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) # 3.b) Plot a histogram to represent the distribution of the sample proportions ggplot(virtual_prop_red_100, aes(x = prop_red)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Proportion of 100 balls that were red&quot;, title = &quot;100&quot;) For easy comparison, we can present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes in Figure 33.12. Figure 33.12: Histograms of sample proportions for different sample sizes. Observe that all three histograms: are centered around the same middle value, which appears to be a value slightly below 0.4, are somewhat bell-shaped, and exhibit sampling variation that is different for each sample size. In particular, as the sample size increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the sample proportions do not vary as much and they seem to get closer to the middle value. These are important characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion: The first observation relates to the shape of the distribution, the second to the center of the distribution, and the last one to the sampling variation and how it is affected by the sample size. These results are not coincidental or isolated to the example of sample proportions of red balls in a bowl. In the next subsection, a theoretical framework is introduced that helps explain with precise mathematical equations the behavior of sample proportions coming from random samples. 33.2 Sampling framework In Section 33.1, we gained some intuition about sampling and its characteristics. In this section, we’ll cover some statistical definitions and terminology related to sampling. We’ll conclude by introducing key characteristics that will be formally studied in the rest of the chapter. 33.2.1 Population, sample, and the sampling distribution A population or study population is a collection of all individuals or observations of interest. In the bowl activities the population is the collection of all the balls in the bowl. A sample is a subset of the population. Sampling is the act of collecting samples from the population. Simple random sampling is sampling where each member of the population has the same chance of being selected, for example, by using a shovel to select balls from a bowl. A random sample is a sample found using simple random sampling. In the bowl activities, physical and virtual, we use simple random sampling to get random samples from the bowl. A population parameter (or simply a parameter) is a numerical summary (a number) that represents some characteristic of the population. A sample statistic (or simply a statistic) is a numerical summary computed from a sample. In the bowl activities the parameter of interest was the population proportion \\(p=\\) 0.375. Similarly, previously a sample of 50 balls was taken and 17 were red. A statistic is the sample proportion which in this example was equal to \\(\\widehat{p}= 0.34\\). Observe how we use \\(p\\) to represent the population proportion (parameter) and \\(\\widehat{p}\\) for the sample proportion (statistic). The distribution of a list of numbers is the set of the possible values in the list and how often they occur. The sampling distribution of the sample proportion is the distribution of sample proportions from each possible random samples of a given size. To illustrate this concept, recall that in Subsection 33.1.3 we drew three histograms shown in Figure 33.12. The histogram on the left, for example, was constructed from taking 1000 random samples of size \\(n=25\\), then finding the sample proportion for each sample and using these proportions to draw the histogram. This histogram is a good visual approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. The sampling distribution can be a difficult concept to grasp right away: The sampling distribution of the sample proportion is the distribution of sample proportions; it is constructed using exclusively sample proportions. People learning this terminology sometimes confuse the term sampling distribution with a sample’s distribution—the latter can be understood as the distribution of the values in a given sample. A histogram from a simulation of sample proportions is only a visual approximation of the sampling distribution. It is not the exact distribution. Still, when the simulations produce a large number of sample proportions, the resulting histogram provides a good approximation of the sampling distribution. This was the case in Subsection 33.1.3 and the three histograms shown in Figure 33.12. The lessons we learned by performing the activities in Section 33.1 contribute to gaining insights about key characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, namely: The center of the sampling distribution The effect of sampling variation on the sampling distribution and the effect of the sample size on this sampling variation The shape of the sampling distribution The first two points relate to measures of central tendency and dispersion, respectively. The last one provides a connection to one of the most important theorems in statistics: the Central Limit Theorem. In the next section, we formally study these characteristics. 33.3 The Central Limit Theorem A fascinating result in statistics is that when retrieving random samples from any population, the corresponding sample means follow a typical behavior: their histogram is bell-shaped and has very unique features. This is true regardless of the distribution of the population values and forms the basis of what we know as the Central Limit Theorem. Before fully describing it, let’s look at a theoretical framework to construct this and other characteristics related to sampling. 33.3.1 Random variables A simple theoretical framework can help us formalize important properties of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. To do this, let’s modify the bowl activity slightly. Instead of using a shovel to select all 25 balls at once, we randomly select one ball at a time, 25 times. If the ball is red we call it a success and record a 1 (one); if it is not red we call it a failure and record a 0 (zero). Then, we return the ball to the bowl so the proportion of red balls in the bowl doesn’t change. This process is called a trial or a Bernoulli trial in honor of Jacob Bernoulli, a 17th-century mathematician who is among the first ones to work with these trials. Getting a sample of 25 balls is running 25 trials and getting 25 numbers, ones or zeros, representing whether or not we have observed red balls on each trial, respectively. The average of these 25 numbers (zeros or ones) represents precisely the proportion or red balls in a sample of 25 balls. It is useful to represent a trial as a random variable. We use the uppercase letter \\(X\\) and the subscript \\(1\\) as \\(X_1\\) to denote the random variable for the first trial. After the first trial is completed, so the color of the first ball is observed, the value of \\(X_1\\) is realized as 1 if the ball is red or 0 if the ball is white. For example, if the first ball is red, we write \\(X_1 = 1\\). Similarly, we use \\(X_2\\) to represent the second trial. For example, if the second ball is white, \\(X_2\\) is realized as \\(X_2=0\\), and so on. \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), \\(\\dots\\) are random variables only before the trials have been performed. After the trials, they are just the ones or zeros representing red or white balls, respectively. Moreover, since our experiment is to perform 25 trials and then find the average of them, this average or mean, before the trials are carried out, can also be expressed as a random variable: \\[\\overline X = \\frac{X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_{25}}{25}.\\] Here \\(\\overline X\\) is the random variable that represents the average, or mean, of these 25 trials. This is why we call \\(\\overline X\\) the sample mean. Again, \\(\\overline X\\) is a random variable before the 25 trials have been performed. After the trials, \\(\\overline X\\) is realized as the average of 25 zeros and ones. For example, if the results of the trials are \\[\\{0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1 \\},\\] the observed value of \\(\\overline X\\) will be \\[\\overline X = \\frac{0+0+0+1+0+1+\\dots+1+0+0+0+1}{25} = \\frac{10}{25}=0.4.\\] So, for this particular example, the sample mean is \\(\\overline X = 0.4\\), which happens to be the sample proportion of red balls in this sample of 25 balls. In the context of Bernoulli trials, because we are finding averages of zeros and ones, these sample means are sample proportions! Connecting with the notation used earlier, observe that after the trials have been completed, \\(\\overline X = \\widehat{p}\\). 33.3.2 The sampling distribution using random variables Suppose that we want to calculate the sample proportion for another random sample of 25 balls. In terms of the random variable \\(\\overline X\\), this is performing 25 trials and finding another 25 values, ones and zeros, for \\(X_1\\), $X_2, \\(\\dots\\), \\(X_{25}\\) and finding their average. For example we might get: \\[\\{1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0\\}\\] Then, the realization of \\(\\overline X\\) will be \\(\\overline X = 9/25 = 0.36\\). This sample proportion was different than the one found earlier, 0.4. The possible values of \\(\\overline X\\) are the possible proportions of red balls for a sample of 25 balls. In other words, the value that \\(\\overline X\\) takes after the trials have been completed is the sample proportion for the observed sample of red and white balls. Moreover, while any given trial can result in choosing a red ball or not (1 or 0), the chances or getting a red ball are influenced by the proportion of red balls in the bowl. For example, if a bowl has more red balls than white, the chances of getting a red ball on any given trial are higher than getting a white ball. Because 1 is the realization of a trial when a red ball is observed, the sample proportion also would tend to be higher. Sampling variation produces different sample proportions for different random samples, but they are influenced by the proportion of red and white balls in the bowl. This is why understanding the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is learning which sample proportions are possible and which proportions are more or less likely to be observed. Since the realization of \\(\\overline X\\) is the observed sample proportion, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion is precisely the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). In the rest of this section, we use both expressions interchangeably. Recall the key characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, now given in terms of \\(\\overline X\\): The center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) The effect of sampling variation on the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) and the effect of the sample size on sampling variation The shape of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) To address these points, we use simulations. Simulations seldom provide the exact structure of the distribution, because an infinite number of samples may be needed for this. A large number of replications often produces a really good approximation of the distribution, though, and can be used to understand well the distribution’s characteristics. Let’s use the output found in Subsection 33.1.3; namely, the sample proportions for samples of size 25, 50, and 100. If we focus on size 25, think of each sample proportion from samples of size 25 as a possible value of \\(\\overline X\\). We now use these sample proportions to illustrate properties of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), the sampling distribution of the sample proportion. 33.3.3 The center of the distribution: the expected value Since the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) is composed of all the sample proportions that can be calculated for a given sample size, the center of this distribution can be understood as the average of all these proportions. This is the value we would expect to get, on average, from all these sample proportions. This is why the center value of the sampling distribution is called the expected value of the sample proportion, and we write \\(E(\\overline X)\\). Based on probability theory, the mean of \\(\\overline X\\) happens to be equal to the population proportion of red balls in the bowl. In Subsection 33.1.1 we determined that the population proportion was 900/2400 = 0.375, therefore \\[E(\\overline X) = p = 0.375.\\] As an illustration, we noted in Subsection 33.1.3 when looking at the histograms in Figure 33.12 that all three histograms were centered at some value between 0.35 and 0.4 (or between 35% and 40%). As we have established now, they are centered exactly at the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\), which is the population proportion. Figure 33.13 displays these histograms again, but this time adds a vertical red line on each of them at the location of the population proportion value, \\(p\\) = 0.375. Figure 33.13: Three sampling distributions with population proportion \\(p\\) marked by vertical line. The results shown seem to agree with the theory. We can further check, using the simulation results, by finding the average of the 1000 sample proportions. We start with the histogram on the left: virtual_prop_red_25 # A tibble: 1,000 × 3 replicate prop_red n &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 0.32 25 2 2 0.24 25 3 3 0.16 25 4 4 0.32 25 5 5 0.44 25 6 6 0.36 25 7 7 0.32 25 8 8 0.36 25 9 9 0.2 25 10 10 0.32 25 # ℹ 990 more rows virtual_prop_red_25 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_25 = mean(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 E_Xbar_25 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.37668 The variable prop_red in data frame virtual_prop_red_25 contains the sample proportions for each of the 1000 samples taken. The average of these sample proportions is presented as object E_Xbar_25 which represents the estimated expected value of \\(\\overline X\\), by using the average of the 1000 sample proportions. Each of the sample proportions is calculated from random samples of 25 balls from the bowl. This average happens to be precisely the same as the population proportion. It is worth spending a moment understanding this result. If we take one random sample of a given size, we know that the sample proportion from this sample would be somewhat different than the population proportion due to sampling variation; however, if we take many random samples of the same size, the average of the sample proportions are expected to be about the same as the population proportion. We present the equivalent results with samples of size 50 and 100: virtual_prop_red_50 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_50 = mean(prop_red)) virtual_prop_red_100 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_100 = mean(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 E_Xbar_50 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.37858 # A tibble: 1 × 1 E_Xbar_100 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.37745 Indeed, the results are about the same as the population proportion. Note that the average of 1000 sample proportions for samples of size 50 was actually 0.379, close to 0.375. This happens because the simulations only approximate the sampling distribution and the expected value. When using simulations we do not expect to achieve the exact theoretical results, rather values that are close enough to support our understanding of the theoretical results. 33.3.4 Sampling variation: standard deviation and standard error Another relevant characteristic observed in Figure 33.13 is how the amount of dispersion or sampling variation changes when the sample size changes. While all the histograms have a similar bell-shaped configuration and are centered at the same value, observe that when… the sample size is \\(n=25\\) (left histogram) the observed sample proportions are about as low as 0.1 and as high as 0.65. the sample size is \\(n=50\\) (middle histogram) the observed sample proportions are about as low as 0.15 and as high as 0.55. the sample size is \\(n=100\\) (right histogram) the observed sample proportions are about as low as 0.20 and as high as 0.5. As the sample size \\(n\\) increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the variation of the sampling distribution decreases. Thus, the values are clustered more and more tightly around the center of the distribution. In other words, the histogram on the left of Figure 33.13 is more spread out than the one in the middle, which in turn is more spread out than the one on the right. We know that the center of the distribution is the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\), which is the population proportion. From this, we can quantify this variation by calculating how far the sample proportions are, on average, from the population proportion. A well-known statistical measurement to quantify dispersion is the standard deviation. We discuss how it works before we continue with the sampling variation problem. The standard deviation Let’s start with an example and introduce some special notation. As an illustration, given four values \\(y_1=3\\), \\(y_2=-1\\), \\(y_3=5\\), and \\(y_4= 9\\), their average is given by \\[\\bar y = \\frac14\\sum_{i=1}^4y_i =\\frac14 (y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4)= \\frac{3-1+5+9}{4}= 2.\\] The capital Greek letter \\(\\Sigma\\) represents the summation of values, and it is useful when a large number of values need to be added. The letter \\(i\\) underneath \\(\\Sigma\\) is the index of summation. It starts at \\(i=1\\), so the first value we are adding is \\(y_{\\bf 1} = 3\\). Afterwards \\(i=2\\), so we add \\(y_{\\bf 2}=-1\\) to our previous result, an so on, as shown in the equation above. The summation symbol can be very useful when adding many numbers or making more complicated operations, such as defining the standard deviation. To construct the standard deviation of a list of values, we find the deviations of each value from their average, square those deviations, find the average of the squared deviations, and take the square root of this average to finish. In our example, the standard deviation is given by \\[\\begin{aligned} SD &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac14\\sum_{i=1}^4(y_i - \\bar y)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(3-2)^2+(-1-2)^2+(5-2)^2+(9-2)^2}{4}} \\\\ &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{1+9+9+49}{4}}=\\sqrt{17} = 4.12 \\end{aligned}\\] Let’s look at another example, this time using R. Let’s again use our bowl activity with red and white balls in the bowl. We’ll create a Boolean variable is_red that corresponds to TRUEs or 1s for red balls and FALSEs or 0s for white balls and using these numbers, we’ll compute the proportion (average of 1s and 0s) using the mean() function and the standard deviation using the sd() function1 inside summarize(): bowl |&gt; mutate(is_red = color == &quot;red&quot;) |&gt; summarize(p = mean(is_red), st_dev = sd(is_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 p st_dev &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375 0.484224 So, the proportion of red balls is 0.375 with a standard deviation of 0.484. The intuition behind the standard deviation can be expressed as follows: if you were to select many balls, with replacement, from the bowl, we would expect the proportion of red balls to be about 0.375, give or take 0.484. In addition, when dealing with proportions, the formula for the standard deviation can be expressed directly in terms of the population proportion, \\(p\\), using the formula: \\[SD = \\sqrt{p(1-p)}.\\] Here is the value of the standard deviation using this alternative formula in R: p &lt;- 0.375 sqrt(p * (1 - p)) [1] 0.484 The value is the same as using the general formula. Now that we have gained a better understanding of the standard deviation, we can discuss the standard deviation in the context of sampling variation for the sample proportion. The standard error Recall that we want to measure the magnitude of the sampling variation for the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) (the sampling distribution of the sample proportion) and want to use the standard deviation for this purpose. We saw earlier that the center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) is the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\). In our case, this is the population proportion \\(p = 0.375\\). The standard deviation will then indicate how far, on average, each possible sample proportion roughly is from the population proportion. If we were to consider using a sample proportion as an estimate of the population proportion, this deviation could be considered the error in estimation. Because of this particular relationship, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution receives a special name: the standard error. Note that all standard errors are standard deviations but not all standard deviations are standard errors. Let’s work again with simulations and the bowl of red and white balls. We’ll take 10,000 random samples of size \\(n=100\\), find the sample proportion for each sample, and calculate the average and standard deviation for these sample proportions. This simulation produces a histogram similar to the one presented on the right in Figure 33.13. To produce this data, we’ll again use the rep_slice_sample() function and mean() and sd() function inside summarize() to produce the desired results: bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 10000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) |&gt; summarize(p = mean(prop_red), SE_Xbar = sd(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 p SE_Xbar &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.375095 0.0478723 Observe that p is the estimated expected value and SE_Xbar is the estimated standard error based on the simulation of taking sample proportions for random samples of size \\(n=100\\). Compare this value with the standard deviation for the entire bowl, discovered earlier. It is one-tenth the size! This is not a coincidence: the standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) is equal to the standard deviation of the population (the bowl) divided by the square root of the sample size. In the case of sample proportions, the standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) can also be determined using the formula: \\[SE(\\overline X) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\] where \\(p\\) is the population proportion and \\(n\\) is the size of our sample. This formula shows that the standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size: as the sample size increases, the standard error decreases. In our example, the standard error is \\[SE(\\overline X) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.375\\cdot(1-0.375)}{100}} = 0.0484\\] p &lt;- 0.375 sqrt(p * (1 - p) / 100) [1] 0.0484 This value is nearly identical to the result found on the simulation above. We’ll repeat this exercise, this time finding the estimated standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) from the simulations done earlier. These simulations are stored in data frames virtual_prop_red_25 and virtual_prop_red_50, when the sample sizes used are \\(n=25\\) and \\(n=50\\), respectively: virtual_prop_red_25 |&gt; summarize(SE_Xbar_50 = sd(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 SE_Xbar_50 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0970525 virtual_prop_red_50 |&gt; summarize(SE_Xbar_100 = sd(prop_red)) # A tibble: 1 × 1 SE_Xbar_100 &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0666605 The standard errors for these examples, based on the proportion of red balls in the bowl and the sample sizes, are here: sqrt(p * (1 - p) / 25) [1] 0.0968 sqrt(p * (1 - p) / 50) [1] 0.0685 The simulations support the standard errors derived using mathematical formulas. The simulations are used to check that in fact the results achieved agree with the theory. Observe also that the theoretical results are constructed based on the knowledge of the population proportion, \\(p\\); by contrast, the simulations produce samples based on the population of interest but produce results only based on information found from samples and sample proportions. The formula for the standard error of the sample proportion given here can actually be derived using facts in probability theory, but its development goes beyond the scope of this book. To learn more about it, please consult more advanced treatments in probability and statistics such as this one. The sampling distribution of the sample proportion So far, we have looked at some of the properties of the sampling distribution for the sampling proportion; namely, the expected value and standard error of \\(\\overline X\\). Let’s now turn our attention to the shape of the sampling distribution. As mentioned before, histograms (such as those seen earlier) provide a good approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). Since we are interested in the shape of the distribution, let’s redraw again the histograms using sample proportions from random samples of size \\(n=25\\), \\(n=50\\), and \\(n=100\\), but this time we’ll add a smooth curve that appears to connect the top parts of each bar in the histogram. These histograms are presented in Figures 33.14, 33.15, and 33.16. The figures represent density histograms where the area of each bar represents the percentage or proportion of observations for the corresponding bin and the total area of each histogram is 1 (or 100%). The ranges for the \\(x-\\) and \\(y-\\)axis on all these plots have been kept constant for appropriate comparisons among them. Figure 33.14: Histogram of the distribution of the sample proportion and the normal curve (n=25). Figure 33.15: Histogram of the distribution of the sample proportion and the normal curve (n=50). Figure 33.16: Histogram of the sampling distribution of the sample proportion and the normal curve (n=100). The curves in red seem to be a fairly good representation of the top bars of the histograms. However, we have not used the simulated data to draw these curves; these bell-shaped curves were extracted from the normal distribution with mean equal to \\(p=0.375\\) and standard deviation equal to \\(\\sqrt{{p(1-p)/n}}\\) where \\(n\\) changes for each histogram. This is a fascinating result due to an application of one of the most important results in statistics: the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that as the sample size, \\(n\\), approaches infinity, the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) approaches the normal distribution (with the appropriate mean and standard deviation). Moreover, it does not depend on the population distribution; the population can be a bowl with red and white balls or anything else. The observant reader might have noticed that, in practice, we cannot take samples of size equal to infinity. What makes the CLT even more relevant for practical purposes is that the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) approximates normality even when the sample size used is fairly small. As you can see in Figure 33.14, even when random samples of size \\(n=25\\) are used, the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) already seems to follow a normal distribution. Observe also that all the curves follow the bell-shaped form of the normal curve but the spread is greater when a smaller sample size has been used and is consistent with the standard error for \\(\\overline X\\) found earlier for each case. 33.3.5 Summary Let’s look at what we have learned about the sampling distribution of the sample proportion: The mean of all the sample proportions will be exactly the same as the population proportion. The standard deviation of the sample proportions, also called the standard error, is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size: the larger the sample size used to calculate sample proportions, the closer those sample proportions will be from the population proportion, on average. As long as the random samples used are large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion (or simply the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\)) will approximate the normal distribution. This is true for sample proportions regardless of the structure of the underlying population distribution; that is, regardless of how many red and white balls are in the bowl, or whether you are performing any other experiment that deals with sample proportions. In case you want to reinforce these ideas a little more, Shuyi Chiou, Casey Dunn, and Pathikrit Bhattacharyya created a 3-minute and 38-second video at https://youtu.be/jvoxEYmQHNM explaining this crucial statistical theorem using the average weight of wild bunny rabbits and the average wingspan of dragons as examples. Figure 33.17 shows a preview of this video. Figure 33.17: Preview of Central Limit Theorem video. 33.4 Second activity: chocolate-covered almonds Let’s extend the results achieved for the sample proportion to a more general case: the sample mean. In this section we show how most of the results for sample proportions extend directly to sample means, but we also highlight important differences when working with the sampling distribution of the sample mean. As we did with sample proportions, we start by illustrating these results with another activity: sampling from a bowl of chocolate-covered almonds, as seen in Figure 33.18. Figure 33.18: A bowl of chocolate-covered almonds. For ease of exposition we refer to each chocolate-covered almond simply as an almond. We are now interested in the average weight in grams of all the almonds in the bowl; this is the population average weight or population mean weight. 33.4.1 The population mean weight of almonds in the bowl The population of interest is all the almonds in the bowl. The bowl is represented virtually by the data frame almonds_bowl included in the moderndive package. The first ten rows are shown here for illustration purposes: almonds_bowl # A tibble: 5,000 × 2 ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.8 2 2 4.2 3 3 3.2 4 4 3.1 5 5 4.1 6 6 3.9 7 7 3.4 8 8 4.2 9 9 3.5 10 10 3.4 # ℹ 4,990 more rows The first variable ID represents a virtual ID number given to each almond, and the variable weight contains the weight in grams for each almond in the bowl. The population mean weight of almonds, a population parameter, can be calculated in R using again the dplyr data-wrangling verbs presented in Chapter 18.2. Observe, in particular, inside the function summarize() the use of the mean(), sd(), and n() functions for the mean weight, the weight’s standard deviation2, and the number of almonds in the bowl: almonds_bowl |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), sd_weight = sd(weight), length = n()) # A tibble: 1 × 3 mean_weight sd_weight length &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 3.64496 0.392109 5000 We have 5,000 almonds in the bowl, the population mean weight is 3.64 grams, and the weight’s standard deviation is 0.392 grams. We used R to compute the mean and standard deviation, but we could have used the formulas instead. If we call \\(x_1\\) the first almond in the bowl, \\(x_2\\) the second, and so on, the mean is given by \\[\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000}\\frac{x_i}{5000}=3.64.\\] and the standard deviation is given by \\[\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{5000}=0.392.\\] The Greek letters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are used to represent the population mean and population standard deviation (the parameters of interest). In addition, since we know the information of the entire bowl, we can draw the distribution of weights of the entire population (bowl) using a histogram: ggplot(almonds_bowl, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) Figure 33.19: Distribution of weights for the entire bowl of almonds. We can see that the weight of almonds ranges from 2.6 to 4.6 grams and the most common weights observed are between 3.6 and 4.0 grams, but the distribution is not symmetric and does not follow any typical pattern. Now that we have a clear understanding of our population of interest and the parameters of interest, we can continue our exploration of the sampling distribution of the sample mean weights of almonds by constructing samples. 33.4.2 Manual sampling and sample means If we randomly select one almond from the bowl, we could determine its weight using a scale, as shown in Figure 33.20: Figure 33.20: One almond on a scale. Let’s now take a random sample of 25 almonds, as shown in Figure 33.21, and determine the sample average weight, or sample mean weight, in grams. Figure 33.21: A random sample of 25 almonds on a scale. Since the total weight is 88.6 grams, as shown in Figure 33.21, the sample mean weight will be \\(88.6/25 = 3.544\\). The moderndive package contains the information of this sample in the almonds_sample data frame. Here, we present the weight of the first 10 almonds in the sample: almonds_sample # A tibble: 25 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 4645 3 2 1 3629 3.9 3 1 4796 4 4 1 2669 3.8 5 1 3488 4.3 6 1 105 4.1 7 1 1762 3.6 8 1 1035 4.2 9 1 4880 3.2 10 1 398 4 # ℹ 15 more rows The almonds_sample data frame in the moderndive package has \\(n=\\) 25 rows corresponding to each almond in the sample shown in Figure 33.21. The first variable replicate indicates this is the first and only replicate since it is a single sample. The second variable ID gives an identification to the particular almond. The third column weight gives the corresponding weight for each almond in grams as a numeric variable, also known as a double (dbl). The distribution of the weights of these 25 are shown in the histogram in Figure 33.22. ggplot(almonds_sample, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) Figure 33.22: Distribution of weight for a sample of 25 almonds. The weights of almonds in this sample range from 2.9 to 4.4 grams. There is not an obvious pattern in the distribution of this sample. Let’s now compute the sample mean using our data-wrangling tools. almonds_sample |&gt; summarize(sample_mean_weight = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate sample_mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.672 The sample mean weight was not too far from the population mean weight of 3.64 grams. The difference between the statistic (sample mean weight) and the parameter (population mean weight) was due to sampling variation. 33.4.3 Virtual sampling We can now perform sampling virtually. The data frame almonds_bowl has 5000 rows, each representing an almond in the bowl. As we did in Section 33.1.3 we can use the rep_slice_sample() function to retrieve 1000 random samples with a sample size set to be 25, and with the number of replicates reps set to 1000. Be sure to scroll through the contents of virtual_samples in RStudio’s viewer. virtual_samples_almonds &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 25, reps = 1000) virtual_samples_almonds # A tibble: 25,000 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3467 3.7 2 1 3784 4.2 3 1 4653 4.2 4 1 2216 4.1 5 1 98 3.5 6 1 2286 3.6 7 1 4597 3.6 8 1 2385 4.3 9 1 3959 3.7 10 1 1497 3.9 # ℹ 24,990 more rows Observe that now virtual_samples_almonds has 1000 \\(\\cdot\\) 25 = 25,000 rows. Using the appropriate data wrangling code, the virtual_mean_weight data frame produces the sample mean almond weight for each random sample, a total of 1000 sample means. virtual_mean_weight &lt;- virtual_samples_almonds |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) virtual_mean_weight # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.792 2 2 3.452 3 3 3.668 4 4 3.5 5 5 3.668 6 6 3.628 7 7 3.62 8 8 3.592 9 9 3.56 10 10 3.776 # ℹ 990 more rows Figure 33.23 presents the histogram for these sample means: ggplot(virtual_mean_weight, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 3.5, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample mean&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 1000 sample means&quot;) Figure 33.23: The distribution of 1000 means based on 1000 random samples of size 25. The sample mean weights observed in the histogram appear to go below 3.4 grams and above 3.85 grams, but those extreme sample means are rare. The most frequent sample means found seem to be those above 3.5 or below 3.8 grams. Furthermore, the histogram is almost symmetric and showing that bell-shaped form, although the left tail of the histogram appears to be slightly longer than the right tail. While we are dealing with sample means now, the conclusions are strikingly similar to those presented in Subsection 33.4.2 when discussing the sampling distribution for the sample proportion. 33.4.4 The sampling distribution of the sample mean As we did in the case of the sample proportion, we are interested in learning key characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, namely: The center of the sampling distribution The effect of sampling variation on the sampling distribution and the effect of the sample size on sampling variation The shape of the sampling distribution 33.4.5 Random variables Once again, we can use random variables to formalize our understanding of the sample distribution of the sample mean. Instead of using Bernoulli trials, as we did in the case of sample proportions, our trials will record the almond weights. Let’s again modify the bowl activity slightly. In lieu of selecting a sample of almonds all at once, we randomly select one almond at a time, we record the weight of the almond and return it to the bowl before selecting another almond, so the configuration of weights and the chances of any of the almonds to be selected is the same every time we choose one. Getting a sample of 25 almonds is performing these trials 25 times to get 25 weights. Then, the average of these 25 numbers is the average weight or mean weight of a sample of 25 almonds. This is what we call a sample mean. Using random variables, we’ll now let uppercase \\(X_1\\) to be the random variable that represents the weight of the first almond before it has been selected, \\(X_2\\) the weight of the second almond, and so on. These are random variables because they can take any possible almond weight value from the bowl. After the first trial is completed, the value of \\(X_1\\) is realized as the weight in grams of the first almond selected. We can represent this value by the lowercase \\(x_1\\) as it is no longer a random variable but a number and we can write \\(X_1 = x_1\\). After the second trial is completed, \\(X_2 = x_2\\), where lowercase \\(x_2\\) is the observed almond weight, and so on. Since our experiment is to perform 25 trials and then find the average of them, this average or mean, before the trials are carried out, can also be expressed as a random variable: \\[\\overline X = \\frac{X_1+X_2+\\dots+X_{25}}{25}.\\] Observe that \\(\\overline X\\) is the average, or mean, of these 25 trials. This is again why \\(\\overline X\\) is called the sample mean. Recall that when dealing with proportions, the trials are Bernoulli trials, represented only with zeros or ones. In this context, sample proportions are a special case of sample means. The trials we use now are not restricted to zeros and ones, and the sample means are no longer sample proportions. For example, let’s focus on the sample of 25 almond weights used earlier and their sample mean: almonds_sample # A tibble: 25 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 4645 3 2 1 3629 3.9 3 1 4796 4 4 1 2669 3.8 5 1 3488 4.3 6 1 105 4.1 7 1 1762 3.6 8 1 1035 4.2 9 1 4880 3.2 10 1 398 4 # ℹ 15 more rows Looking at the weights in the data frame almonds_sample, observe that \\(X_1 = 3.0\\) grams, \\(X_2 = 3.9\\) grams, \\(X_3 = 4.0\\) grams, and so on. If you view the entire data frame, for example running View(almonds_sample) in R, you could check that \\(X_{23} = 3.3\\), \\(X_{24} = 4.4\\), and \\(X_{25} = 3.6\\), so the sample mean would be \\[\\overline X = \\frac{3.0+3.9+4.0+\\dots+3.3+4.4+3.6}{25} = \\frac{91.8}{25}=3.67.\\] In R: almonds_sample |&gt; summarize(sample_mean_weight = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate sample_mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.672 So, once this sample was observed, the random variable \\(\\overline X\\) was realized as \\(\\overline X = 3.67\\): the sample mean was 3.67 grams. Note that the possible values that \\(\\overline X\\) can take are all the possible sample means from samples of 25 almonds from the bowl. The chances of getting these sample means are determined by the configuration of almond weights in the bowl. When \\(\\overline X\\) is constructed as the sample mean of a given random sample, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is precisely the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). In this context, recall what we are interested in determining: the center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\) and the effect of the sample size on sampling variation, and the shape of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). As we did when dealing with sample proportions, we can use simulations to produce good approximations of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), the sample mean weight of almonds. We’ll also work with samples of size 25, 50, and 100 to learn about changes in sample variation when the sample size changes. This is the process we follow: we generate 1000 samples, calculate the sample means of almond weights, and use them to draw histograms. We do this three times with the size argument set to 25, 50, and 100, respectively. We run each of the following code segments individually and then compare the resulting histograms. # Segment 1: sample size = 25 ------------------------------ # 1.a) Calculating the 1000 sample means, each from random samples of size 25 virtual_mean_weight_25 &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 25, reps = 1000)|&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), n = n()) # 1.b) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_mean_weight_25, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, boundary = 3.6, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample mean weights for random samples of 25 almonds&quot;, title = &quot;25&quot;) # Segment 2: sample size = 50 ------------------------------ # 2.a) Calculating the 1000 sample means, each from random samples of size 50 virtual_mean_weight_50 &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000)|&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), n = n()) # 2.b) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_mean_weight_50, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, boundary = 3.6, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample mean weights for random samples of 50 almonds&quot;, title = &quot;50&quot;) # Segment 3: sample size = 100 ------------------------------ # 3.a) Calculating the 1000 sample means, each from random samples of size 100 virtual_mean_weight_100 &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 100, reps = 1000)|&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), n = n()) # 3.b) Plot distribution via a histogram ggplot(virtual_mean_weight_100, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, boundary = 3.6, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Sample mean weights for random samples of 100 almonds&quot;, title = &quot;100&quot;) We present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes in Figure 33.24 so the comparison among them is clear. Figure 33.24: Comparing histograms of sample means when using different sample sizes. Observe that all three histograms are bell-shaped and appear to center around the same middle value highlighted by the line at the middle. In addition, the magnitude of the sampling variation decreases when the sample size increases. As it happened with the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, the measures of center and dispersion of these distributions are directly related to the parameters of the population: the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), and the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\). Let’s print these parameters one more time here: almonds_bowl |&gt; summarize(mu = mean(weight), sigma = sd(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 mu sigma &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.64496 0.392109 Let’s do the same for our simulations next. Recall that the expected value of \\(\\overline X\\) is the value we would expect to observe, on average, when we take many sample means from random samples of a given size. It is located at the center of the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). Similarly, the standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) is the measure of dispersion or magnitude of sampling variation. It is the standard deviation of the sample means calculated from all possible random samples of a given size. Using the data wrangling code mean() and sd() functions inside summarize() and applied to our simulation values, we can estimate the expected value and standard error of \\(\\overline X\\). Three sets of values are found, one for each of the corresponding sample sizes and presented in Table 33.1. # n = 25 virtual_mean_weight_25 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_25 = mean(mean_weight), sd = sd(mean_weight)) # n = 50 virtual_mean_weight_50 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_50 = mean(mean_weight), sd = sd(mean_weight)) # n = 100 virtual_mean_weight_100 |&gt; summarize(E_Xbar_100 = mean(mean_weight), sd = sd(mean_weight)) Table 33.1: Comparing expected values and standard errors for three different sample sizes Sample size Expected Value Standard Error 25 3.65 0.077 50 3.65 0.053 100 3.65 0.038 In summary: The estimated expected value was either 3.65 or 3.64. This is either near or equal to \\(\\mu = 3.64\\), the population mean weight of almonds in the entire bowl. The standard error decreases when the sample size increases. If we focus on the result for \\(n=100\\), the standard error was 0.038. When compared with the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 0.392\\) this standard error is about one-tenth the value of \\(\\sigma\\). Similarly, when \\(n=25\\) the standard error 0.077 is about one-fifth the value of \\(\\sigma\\) and that pattern also holds when \\(n=50\\). As was the case for the sample proportion, the standard error is inversely proportional to the squared sample size used to construct the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\). This is also a theoretical result that can be expressed as: \\[SE_{\\overline X} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt {n}}\\] where \\(n\\) is the sample size and \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation. 33.4.6 The Central Limit Theorem revisited Finally, observe that the shapes of the histograms in Figure 33.24 are bell-shaped and seem to approximate the normal distribution. As we did with proportions, in Figures 33.25 and 33.26 we compare our histograms with the theoretical curve for the normal distribution. Figure 33.25: The distribution of the sample mean (n=25). Figure 33.26: The distribution of the sample mean (n=100). We can conclude that the distribution of \\(\\overline X\\), that is, the sampling distribution of the sample mean, when the sample size is large enough, follows approximately a normal distribution with mean equal to the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), and standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, \\(\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). We can write this as \\[\\overline X \\sim Normal \\left(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt n}\\right)\\] 33.5 The sampling distribution in other scenarios In Sections 33.1, 33.3, and 33.4, we have considered information about the expected value, the standard error, and the shape of the sampling distribution when the statistic of interest are sample proportions or sample means. It is possible to study the sampling distribution of other statistics. In this section we explore some of them. 33.5.1 Sampling distribution for two samples Assume that we would like to compare the parameters of two populations, for example, the means or proportion of those populations. To do this a random sample is taken from the first population and another random sample, independent from the first, is retrieved from the second population. Then we can use a statistic from each sample, such as the sample mean or sample proportion, and use them to produce sampling distributions that depend on two independent samples. We provide two examples to illustrate how the sampling distributions are affected. Difference in sample means The problem at hand could be that the chocolate-covered almonds’ weight for almonds in a bowl needs to be compared with the chocolate-covered coffee beans’ weight for coffee beans in a different bowl. The statistic we now consider is the difference in the sample means for samples taken from these two bowls. As it happens, most of the properties we have presented for a single sample mean or sample proportion can be extended directly to two-sample problems. Let’s now consider the mathematical details for this problem. We assume that for the chocolate-covered almonds’ weight, the population mean and standard deviation are given by \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_1\\) and for the chocolate-covered coffee beans’ weight the population mean and standard deviation are given by \\(\\mu_2\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\). Our sampling exercise has two components. First, we take a random sample of size \\(n_1\\) from the almonds’ bowl and find the sample mean. We let \\(\\overline X_1\\) represent the possible sample mean values for each possible almond sample. Then, we let \\(n_2\\) and \\(\\overline X_2\\) represent similar quantities for the coffee beans’ bowl. To compare these two sample means, we look at the difference, \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). The distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\) is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means. The expected value and standard error of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\) is given by \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) and \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_2}{n_2}},\\] respectively. If the distributions of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are approximately normal due to the CLT, so is the distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). We can write all these properties at once: \\[\\overline X - \\overline Y \\sim Normal \\left(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_2}{n_2}} \\right)\\] Observe how the standard deviation of the difference is the sum of squared standard deviations from each sample mean. The reason we add standard deviations instead of subtract is because whether you add or subtract statistics, you are effectively adding more uncertainty into your results and the dispersion increases because of it. Difference in sample proportions Comparing two sample proportions can be very useful. We may be interested in comparing the proportion of patients that improve using one treatment versus the proportion of patients that improve using a different treatment, or the proportion of winter accidents on a highway using one type of tire versus another. To illustrate how the sampling distribution works for the difference in sample proportions, we can modify the examples used earlier. Assume that we want to compare the proportion of red balls in the first bowl with the proportion of almonds that are heavier than 3.8 grams in the second bowl. This example shows one way to convert numeric data like almond weights into a Boolean result instead. The statistic we now consider is the difference in these sample proportions for samples retrieved from these two bowls.The samples from each bowl do not need to be of the same size; for example, we can take samples of size \\(n_1 = 50\\) from the first bowl and samples of size \\(n_2 = 60\\) from the second bowl. We proceed by taking a random sample from the first bowl, calculating the sample proportion of red balls, getting a random sample from the second bowl, calculating the proportion of almonds heavier than 3.8 grams, and finding the difference in sample proportion of red balls minus the sample proportion of almonds greater than 3.8 grams (the resulting statistic). We can use R to produce the required virtual samples and differences. We’ll then use them to approximate the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions. Our sampling exercise has again two components. First, we take a random sample of \\(n_1 = 50\\) balls from the bowl of red balls and calculate the sample proportion or red balls. As we did before, we let \\(\\overline X_1\\) represent the possible values that the sample proportion can take for each possible sample. Recall that \\(\\overline X_1\\) is the sample proportion in this context, which is also the sample mean of Bernoulli trials. Second, we let \\(n_2 = 60\\) represent the sample size used for samples from the almonds’ bowl and the random variable \\(\\overline X_2\\) represent the possible values that the sample proportion of almonds greater than 3.8 grams can take for each possible sample. To compare these two sample proportions, we find the difference, \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). The distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\) is the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions. We use virtual sampling to approximate this distribution. We’ll use the rep_slice_sample and summarize functions to produce the random samples and the necessary sample proportions, respectively. A total of 1000 random samples and sample proportions are acquired from each bowl with the appropriate sample sizes, 50 and 60, respectively. Moreover, the inner_join function introduced in Section 18.2.5 is used here to merge the sample proportions into a single data frame and the difference in these sample proportions is calculated for each replication. virtual_prop_red &lt;- bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 50, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_red = mean(color == &quot;red&quot;)) virtual_prop_almond &lt;- almonds_bowl |&gt; rep_slice_sample(n = 60, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(prop_almond = mean(weight &gt; 3.8)) prop_joined &lt;- virtual_prop_red |&gt; inner_join(virtual_prop_almond, by = &quot;replicate&quot;) |&gt; mutate(prop_diff = prop_red - prop_almond) The results are stored in the data frame prop_joined. The variable prop_diff in this data frame represents the difference in sample proportions. Here are the first 10 values of this data frame: prop_joined # A tibble: 1,000 × 4 replicate prop_red prop_almond prop_diff &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.24 0.45 -0.21 2 2 0.46 0.5 -0.0400000 3 3 0.38 0.35 0.0300000 4 4 0.36 0.433333 -0.0733333 5 5 0.38 0.366667 0.0133333 6 6 0.3 0.316667 -0.0166667 7 7 0.42 0.383333 0.0366667 8 8 0.42 0.483333 -0.0633333 9 9 0.32 0.5 -0.18 10 10 0.48 0.433333 0.0466667 # ℹ 990 more rows As we did before, we’ll build a histogram for these 1000 differences in Figure 33.27. ggplot(prop_joined, aes(x = prop_diff)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 0, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Difference in sample proportions&quot;, title = &quot;Histogram of 1000 differences in sample proportions&quot;) Figure 33.27: The distribution of 1000 differences in sample proportions based on 1000 random samples of size 50 from the first bowl and 1000 random samples of size 60 from the second bowl. The sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions also looks bell-shaped and it appears to be centered at some negative value somewhere around -0.05. As it happened with a single sample proportion or a sample mean, the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions also follows a normal distribution and the expected difference as well as the standard error rely on information from the population and the sample size. Here are the mathematical details: \\(\\overline X_1\\) is the random variable that represents the sample proportion of red balls of size \\(n_1 = 50\\), \\(\\overline X_2\\) is the random variable that represents the sample proportion of almonds heavier than 3.8 grams, taken from samples of size \\(n_2 = 60\\). The proportion of red balls the population proportion and standard deviation are given by \\(p_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)}\\) and for the almonds’ weight the population proportion and standard deviation are given by \\(p_2\\) and \\(\\sigma_2 = \\sqrt{p_2(1-p_2)}\\). The expected value and standard error of the difference, \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\), is given by \\(p_1 - p_2\\) and \\[\\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}},\\] respectively. If the distributions of \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\) are approximately normal due to the CLT, so is the distribution of \\(\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2\\). We can write all these properties at once: \\[\\overline X_1 - \\overline X_2 \\sim Normal \\left(p_1 - p_2, \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}} \\right)\\] 33.6 Summary and final remarks 33.6.1 Summary of scenarios These are not the only cases where the sampling distribution can be determined. For example, when performing linear regression, we can find the sampling distribution for the slope of the regression line and the behavior will be similar to what we have described here. We will discuss inference in the context of linear regression in the future. For now, let’s look at a summary of the different scenarios presented in this chapter. Table 33.2: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}_1 - \\widehat{\\mu}_2\\) 5 Population regression slope \\(\\beta_1\\) Fitted regression slope \\(b_1\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) 33.6.2 What’s to come? In the next module, we will delve deeper into the concept of statistical inference, building upon the foundations we have already established in this chapter on sampling. This chapter introduces us to the idea of estimating population parameters using sample data, a key aspect of inferential statistics. We will explore how to construct and interpret confidence intervals, particularly focusing on understanding what they imply about population parameters. This involves grasping the concept of a confidence level and recognizing the limitations and proper usage of confidence intervals. The chapter is designed to enhance our practical understanding through examples and applications, enabling us to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. The sd() function actually calculates the sample standard deviation, which divides the sum of squared deviations by \\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\). The difference is noticeable for small numbers of values but almost irrelevant, for practical purposes, when using a large number of values. It is used here for simplicity.↩︎ As explained earlier, this function produces the sample standard deviation, which divides the sum of square deviations by \\(n-1\\) instead of \\(n\\), but for a list of 5000 observations the difference is not relevant, for practical purposes.↩︎ "],["m11c-explore-sampling-with-your-own-data.html", "34 M11C: Explore Sampling With Your Own Data", " 34 M11C: Explore Sampling With Your Own Data You will complete the Module 11 Connection activity on Canvas.

On one hand, they’re an important recognition that even with the best applications of statistical analysis, we never have a perfect answer to the questions that we’re asking. However, they also let us skip the step of throwing our hands up in despair about the impossibility of knowing and give us a practical workaround: We may not know the exact answer, but we have a certain level of confidence that the answer falls within a given range. As we’ll see in future weeks, this kind of reasoning is really helpful in inferential statistics. Sure, we can’t answer whether a given measurement is the “correct” value, but we can use the basic ideas behind confidence intervals to shift our attention to a different question: What values are unlikely to be “correct”? In other words, values outside of a confidence interval are unlikely to correspond with a given true value for a particular measurement, and knowing that can be a lot more helpful. I’m being a bit ambiguous here: We need to read more about confidence intervals this week and lay some more conceptual groundwork next week before we really see how confidence intervals support inferential statistics. However, the basic idea ought to be clear by the end of this week: The more confident we are that a value ought to fall within a certain range, the more suspicious that we ought to be of values that fall outside of that range. That said, even though this kind of reasoning comes with a certain amount of statistical humility, it promotes an idea of normativity. That is, an idea that certain values of a particular variable are normal, and other values are abnormal, and we ought to be suspicious of abnormal values. Let’s be clear—sometimes, this reasoning is appropriate and helpful! I’m really glad that my physician can make distinctions between when my heart is behaving normally and when it’s behaving abnormally—and I’m glad that she raises suspicion when it’s behaving abnormally. However, there are also times that our confidence in the normality of certain things (and the suspicious abnormality of other things) is misplaced. Overconfidence in what is normal and what isn’t can lead to discrimination against and even persecution of people who don’t fit a particular image of normality, and that’s not a good thing. The bulk of this reading is going to include a story along these lines that I’ve taken from Dr. Sasha Costanza-Chock’s book Design Justice, as I’ve indicated above. Previously in the semester, when I’ve adapted a reading from another source, I’ve typically taken advantage of the permissive license applied to the source to add my own voice to it, edit the original language, etc. However, this is a highly personal story from Dr. Costanza-Chock, and it would be wildly inappropriate for me to take that same approach here. In a few cases, I have removed language that makes reference to later chapters in her book (because that could be confusing here), I have changed the citation style to fit with the rest of our readings, and I have broken up one paragraph that got overly long after making changes to citation style. Other than that, though, I have kept Dr. Costanza-Chock’s original language intact, and all first-person pronouns refer to her, not me. To make this more clear, I have used “blockquote formatting” (like this paragraph) to represent her language. As you read the story, consider how statistics, confidence, and normativity play a role in making travel by plane more difficult for some people than others. As with previous readings, this isn’t an argument for throwing out confidence intervals and the rest of data science—rather, this is another reminder of how important it is that we be mindful and careful in the ways that we apply data science in the world. 35.2 #TravelingWhileTrans It’s June 2017, and I’m standing in the security line at the Detroit Metro Airport. I’m on my way back to Boston from the Allied Media Conference (AMC), a “collaborative laboratory of media-based organizing” that’s been held every year in Detroit for the past two decades (see alliedmedia.org). At the AMC, over two thousand people—media makers, designers, activists and organizers, software developers, artists, filmmakers, researchers, and all kinds of cultural workers—gather each June to share ideas and strategies for how to create a more just, creative, and collaborative world. As a nonbinary, trans*, femme-presenting person, my time at the AMC was deeply liberating (For a recent discussion of the increasingly widespread use of the term trans* with an asterisk, see Halberstam [2018]). It’s a conference that strives harder than any that I know of to be inclusive of all kinds of people, including queer, trans*, intersex, and gender-non-conforming (QTI/GNC) folks. Although it’s far from perfect, and every year inevitably brings new challenges and difficult conversations about what it means to construct a truly inclusive space, it’s a powerful experience. Emerging from nearly a week immersed in this parallel world, I’m tired, but on a deep level, refreshed; my reservoir of belief in the possibility of creating better futures has been replenished. I will certainly be spared the most disruptive and harmful possible outcomes of security screening. For example, I don’t have to worry that this process will lead to my being placed in a detention center or in deportation proceedings; I won’t be hooded and whisked away to Guantanamo Bay or to one of the many other secret prisons that form part of the global infrastructure of the so-called war on terror (Sadat, 2005); most likely, I won’t even miss my flight while detained for what security expert Bruce Schneier (2006) describes as “security theater.” Only once in all of my travels have I been taken aside, placed into a waiting room, and subjected to additional questioning by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Despite my participation in social movement networks, including the global justice movement, Indymedia, the immigrant rights movement, countersurveillance work, and more, my white skin, institutional affiliations, educational background, and US citizenship have largely protected me from the most egregious types of abuse by state power. On the other hand, my heartbeat speeds up slightly as I near the end of the line, because I know that I’m almost certainly about to experience an embarrassing, uncomfortable, and perhaps humiliating search by a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer, after my body is flagged as anomalous by the millimeter wave scanner. I know that this is almost certainly about to happen because of the particular sociotechnical configuration of gender normativity (cis-normativity, or the assumption that all people have a gender identity that is consistent with the sex they were assigned at birth) that has been built into the scanner, through the combination of user interface (UI) design, scanning technology, binary-gendered body-shape data constructs, and risk detection algorithms, as well as the socialization, training, and experience of the TSA agents (Costello, 2016). TSA agent motions me to step into the millimeter wave scanner. I raise my arms and place my hands in a triangle shape, palms facing forward, above my head. The scanner spins around my body, and then the agent signals for me to step forward out of the machine and wait with my feet on the pad just past the scanner exit. I glance to the left, where a screen displays an abstracted outline of a human body. As I expected, bright fluorescent yellow pixels on the flat-panel display highlight my groin area. You see, when I entered the scanner, the TSA operator on the other side was prompted by the UI to select Male or Female; the button for Male is blue, the button for Female is pink. Since my gender presentation is nonbinary femme, usually the operator selects Female. However, the three-dimensional contours of my body, at millimeter resolution, differ from the statistical norm of female bodies as understood by the data set and risk algorithm designed by the manufacturer of the millimeter wave scanner (and its subcontractors), and as trained by a small army of clickworkers tasked with labeling and classification (as scholars Lilly Irani [2016], Nick Dyer-Witheford [2016], Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri [2019], among others, remind us). If the agent selects Male, my breasts are large enough, statistically speaking, in comparison to the normative male body-shape construct in the database, to trigger an anomaly warning and a highlight around my chest area. If they select Female, my groin area deviates enough from the statistical female norm to trigger the risk alert. In other words, I can’t win. This sociotechnical system is sure to mark me as “risky,” and that will trigger an escalation to the next level in the TSA security protocol.” This is, in fact, what happens: I’ve been flagged. The screen shows a fluorescent yellow highlight around my groin. Next, the agent asks me to step aside, and (as usual) asks for my consent to a physical body search. Typically, once I’m close enough, the agent becomes confused about my gender. This presents a problem, because the next fork in the security protocol is for either a male or female TSA agent to conduct a body search by running their hands across my arms and armpits, chest, hips and legs, and inner thighs. According to TSA policy, “if a pat-down is performed, it will be conducted by an officer of the same gender as you present yourself” (see https://www.tsa.gov/transgender-passengers). Sometimes, the agent will assume I prefer to be searched by a female agent; sometimes, a male. Occasionally, they ask for my preference. Unfortunately, “neither” is an honest but unacceptable response. Today, I’m particularly unlucky: a nearby male-presenting agent, observing the interaction, loudly states “I’ll do it!” and strides over to me. I say, “Aren’t you going to ask me what I prefer?” He pauses, then begins to move toward me again, but the female-presenting agent who is operating the scanner stops him. She asks me what I prefer. Now I’m standing in public, flanked by two TSA agents, with a line of curious travelers watching the whole interaction. Ultimately, the male-presenting agent backs off and the female-presenting agent searches me, making a face as if she’s as uncomfortable as I am, and I’m cleared to continue on to my gate. The point of this story is to provide a small but concrete example from my own daily lived experience of how larger systems—including norms, values, and assumptions—are encoded in and reproduced through the design of sociotechnical systems, or in political theorist Langdon Winner’s (1980) famous words, how “artifacts have politics.” In this case, cis-normativity is enforced at multiple levels of a traveler’s interaction with airport security systems. The database, models, and algorithms that assess deviance and risk are all binary and cis-normative. The male/female gender selector UI is binary and cis-normative. As Anna Lauren Hoffmann notes about the simplified gender binary interface, “The thing that really gets me is that this screen was developed as a privacy-preserving compromise after folks realized the level of detail these machines were actually capable of rendering!” The assignment of a male or female TSA agent to perform the additional, more invasive search is cis-normative and binary-gender normative as well. At each stage of this interaction, airport security technology, databases, algorithms, risk assessment, and practices are all designed based on the assumption that there are only two genders, and that gender presentation will conform with so-called biological sex. Anyone whose body doesn’t fall within an acceptable range of “deviance” from a normative binary body type is flagged as risky and subjected to a heightened and disproportionate burden of the harms (both small and, potentially, large) of airport security systems and the violence of empire they instantiate. QTI/GNC people are thus disproportionately burdened by the design of millimeter wave scanning technology and the way that technology is used. The system is biased against us. Most cisgender people are unaware of the fact that the millimeter wave scanners operate according to a binary and cis-normative gender construct; most trans* people know, because it directly affects our lives. In 2009, Toby Beauchamp wrote about state surveillance and trans* concealment/visibility. In September of 2016, Shadi Petosky brought national attention to the challenges of #TravelingWhileTrans when she live-tweeted her experience with an invasive search by TSA agents at the Orlando airport, after she was flagged in a millimeter wave scan for presenting as female while having a penis (see Lee, 2016). These systems are biased against QTI/GNC people, as I’ve described; against Black women, who frequently experience invasive searches of their hair, as documented by the team of investigative journalists at ProPublica; and against Sikh men, Muslim women, and others who wear headwraps, as described by sociologist Simone Browne (2015) in her brilliant book Dark Matters. As Browne discusses, and as Joy Buolamwini (2017), founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, technically demonstrates, gender itself is racialized: humans have trained our machines to categorize faces and bodies as male and female through lenses tinted by the optics of white supremacy. Airport security is also systematically biased against Disabled people, who are more likely to be flagged as risky if they have non-normative body shapes and/or use prostheses, as well as anyone who uses a wearable or implanted medical device. Those who are simultaneously QTI/GNC, Black, Indigenous, people of color (PoC), Muslim, Sikh, immigrant, and/or Disabled are doubly, triply, or multiply burdened by, and face the highest risk of harms from, this system. I first publicly shared this experience in an essay for the Journal of Design and Science that I wrote in response to the “Resisting Reduction” manifesto (Ito, 2017), a timely call for thoughtful conversation about the limits and possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI). That call resonated very deeply with me because as a nonbinary trans* feminine person, I walk through a world that has in many ways been designed to deny the possibility of my existence. The same cisnormative, racist, and ableist approach that is used to train the models of the millimeter wave scanners is now being used to develop AI in nearly every domain. From my standpoint, I worry that the current path of AI development will reproduce systems that erase those of us on the margins, whether intentionally or not, through the mundane and relentless repetition of reductive norms in a thousand daily interactions with AI systems that, increasingly, weave the very fabric of our lives. 35.3 Conclusion Not all of the normativity described by Dr. Costanza-Chock in this story is a result of data science and confidence intervals, but data science and confidence intervals nearly always contribute to our ideas of what is normal and what is suspiciously abnormal. We cannot allow ourselves to use data science in a way that makes some people normal and other people suspiciously abnormal—and yet, as Dr. Costanza-Chock suggests, this is something that is already happening. As you continue working with data science in this class and in other spaces, think carefully about what you’re placing confidence in and whether that is warranted! 35.4 References Beauchamp, T.

Recall, for example, getting many random samples of red and white balls from a bowl, finding the sample proportions of red balls from each of those samples, and studying the distribution of the sample proportions. We can summarize our findings as follows: the sampling distribution of the sample proportion follows, approximately, the normal distribution, the expected value of the sample proportion, located at the center of the distribution, is exactly equal to the population proportion, and the sampling variation, measured by the standard error of the sample proportion, is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size used to collect the samples. Similarly, when sampling chocolate-covered almonds and getting the sample mean weight from each sample, the characteristics described above are also encountered in the sampling distribution of the sample mean; namely, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows, approximately, the normal distribution; the expected value of the sample mean is the population mean, and the standard error of the sample mean is the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. Moreover, these characteristics also apply to sampling distributions for the difference in sample means, the difference in sample proportions, and others. Recall that the sampling distribution is not restricted by the distribution of the population. As long as the samples taken are fairly large and we use the appropriate standard error, we can generalize these results appropriately. The study of the sampling distribution is motivated by another question we have not yet answered: how can we determine the average weight of all the almonds if we do not have access to the entire bowl? We have seen by using simulations that the average of the sample means, derived from many random samples, will be fairly close to the expected value of the sample mean, which is precisely the population mean weight. However, in real-life situations, we do not have access to many random samples, only to a single random sample. This chapter introduces methods and techniques that can help us approximate the information of the entire population, such as the population mean weight, by using a single random sample from this population. This undertaking is called estimation, and it is central to statistics and data science. We’re going to look at some statistical jargon about estimation (hooray?). If we are using a sample statistic to estimate a population parameter, e.g., using the sample mean from a random sample to estimate the population mean, we call this statistic a point estimate to make emphasis that it is a single value that is used to estimate the parameter of interest. Now, you may recall that, due to sampling variation, the sample mean typically does not match the population mean exactly, even if the sample is large. To account for this variation, we use an interval to estimate the parameter instead of a single value, and appropriately call it an interval estimate or, if given some level of accuracy, a confidence interval of the population parameter. In this chapter, we’ll look at how to find confidence intervals, the advantages of using them, and the different methods that can be used to determine them. In Section 36.1 we’ll look at a method to build a confidence interval for the population mean that uses the random sample taken and theoretical characteristics of the sampling distribution discussed during the last module. We can call this the theory-based approach for constructing intervals. In Section 36.2, I’ll introduce another method, called the bootstrap, that produces confidence intervals by resampling a large number of times from the original sample. Since resampling is done via simulations, we can call this the simulation-based approach for constructing confidence intervals. Finally, in Section 36.4 I’ll summarize and present extensions of these methods. Needed packages If needed, read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(infer) Recall that loading the tidyverse package loads many packages that we have encountered earlier. For details refer to Section 18.4. The packages moderndive and infer contain functions and data frames that will be used in this chapter. 36.1 Tying the sampling distribution to estimation In this section, we’ll revisit the chocolate-covered almonds example we looked at previously, as well as the results from the sampling distribution of the sample mean weight of almonds. This time, though, we’ll use this information in the context of estimation. Let’s start by introducing or reviewing some terminology using the almonds example. The bowl of chocolate-covered almonds is the population of interest. The parameter of interest is the population mean weight of almonds in the bowl, \\(\\mu\\). This is the quantity we want to estimate. We want to use the sample mean to estimate this parameter. So we’ll call the sample mean an estimator or an estimate of \\(\\mu\\), the population mean weight. The difference between estimator and estimate is worth discussing. As an illustration, let’s decide to take a random sample of 100 almonds from the bowl and use its sample mean weight to estimate the population mean weight. In other words, we want to sum 100 almonds’ weights, divide this sum by 100, and use this value to estimate the population mean weight. When we refer to the sample mean to describe this process via an equation, the sample mean weight is called an estimator of the population mean weight. Since different samples produce different sample means, the sample mean as an estimator is the random variable \\(\\overline X\\) described in Section 33.4.5. As we have learned previously studying the sampling distribution, we know that this estimator follows, approximately, a normal distribution; its expected value is equal to the population mean weight. Its standard deviation, also called standard error, is \\[SE(\\bar x) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] where \\(n = 100\\) in this example and \\(\\sigma\\) is the population standard deviation of almonds’ weights. Let’s take a random sample of 100 almonds’ weights such and store it in the moderndive package with the same name: almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 166 4.2 2 1 1215 4.2 3 1 1899 3.9 4 1 1912 3.8 5 1 4637 3.3 6 1 511 3.5 7 1 127 4 8 1 4419 3.5 9 1 4729 4.2 10 1 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows We can use it to calculate the sample mean weight: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate sample_mean &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 Then \\(\\overline{x} = 3.682\\) grams is an estimate of the population mean weight. In summary, the estimator is the procedure, equation, or method that will be used on a sample to estimate a parameter before the sample has been retrieved and has many useful properties discussed in the sampling walkthrough. The moment a sample is taken and the equation of a sample mean is applied to this sample, the resulting number is an estimate. The sample mean, as an estimator or estimate of the population mean, will be a central component of the material developed in this chapter. Note, though, that it is not the only quantity of interest. For example, the population standard deviation of the almonds’ weight, denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\sigma\\), is a parameter and the sample standard deviation can be an estimator or estimate of this parameter. Furthermore, we saw in our walkthrough on sampling that the expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean. When this happens, we call the sample mean an unbiased estimator of the population mean. This does not mean that any sample mean will be equal to the population mean; some sample means will be greater while others will be smaller but, on average, they will be equal to the population mean. In general, when the expected value of an estimator is equal to the parameter it is trying to estimate, we call the estimator unbiased. If it is not, the estimator is biased. Let’s now revisit the almond activity and study how the sampling distribution of the sample mean can help us build interval estimates for the population mean. 36.1.1 Revisiting the almond activity for estimation During our sampling walkthrough one of the activities was to take many random samples of size 100 from a bowl of 5,000 chocolate-covered almonds. Since we have access to the contents of the entire bowl, we can compute the population parameters: almonds_bowl |&gt; summarize(population_mean = mean(weight), population_sd = pop_sd(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 population_mean population_sd &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.64496 0.392070 The total number of almonds in the bowl is 5,000. The population mean is \\[\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000}\\frac{x_i}{5000}=3.645,\\] and the population standard deviation, pop_sd(), from moderndive, is defined as \\[\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^{5000} \\frac{(x_i - \\mu)^2}{5000}=0.392.\\] Let’s hold on to those numbers for future reference to determine how well our methods of estimation are doing. We’ll assign those numbers to R objects with names that mirror the Greek letters that we use to refer to population means and population standard deviations. Note that this uses some syntax that we haven’t really worked with in the past; however, it’s the easiest way to get what we want for these purposes. mu &lt;- mean(almonds_bowl$weight) mu [1] 3.64 sigma &lt;- pop_sd(almonds_bowl$weight) sigma [1] 0.392 Remember, though, that in real-life situations we do not have access to the population values and the population mean \\(\\mu\\) and population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) are unknown. All we have is the information from one random sample. In our example, we assume that all we know is the almonds_sample_100 object stored in moderndive. Its ID variable shows the almond chosen from the bowl and its corresponding weight. Using this sample we calculate some sample statistics: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight), sd_weight = sd(weight), sample_size = n()) # A tibble: 1 × 4 replicate mean_weight sd_weight sample_size &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 1 3.682 0.362199 100 In one of our sampling activities, we took many random samples, calculated their sample means, constructed a histogram using these sample means, and showed how the histogram is a good approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Let’s redraw Figure 33.26 here as Figure 36.1. Please note that because of some display limitations that emerged with a recent package update, \\(\\bar x\\) is displayed here (and in some future plots) as “xbar.” Figure 36.1: The distribution of the sample mean. The histogram in Figure 36.1 is drawn using many sample mean weights from random samples of size \\(n=100\\).The added red smooth curve is the density curve for the normal distribution with the appropriate expected value and standard error calculated from the sample distribution. The red dot represents the population mean \\(\\mu\\), the unknown parameter we are trying to estimate. The blue right is the sample mean \\(\\overline{x} = 3.682\\) from the random sample stored in almonds_sample_100. In real-life applications, a sample mean is taken from a sample, but the distribution of the population and the population mean are unknown, so the location of the blue dot with respect to the red dot is also unknown. However, if we construct an interval centered on the blue dot, as long as it is wide enough the interval will contain the red dot. To understand this better, we need to learn a few additional properties of the normal distribution. 36.1.2 The normal distribution A random variable can take on different values. When those values can be represented by one or more intervals, the likelihood of those values can be expressed graphically by a density curve on a Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions. The horizontal axis (X-axis) represents the values that the random variable can take and the height of density curve (Y-axis) provides a graphical representation of the likelihood of those values; the higher the curve the more likely those values are. In addition, the total area under a density curve is always equal to 1. The set of values a random variable can take alongside their likelihood is what we call the distribution of a random variable. The normal distribution is the distribution of a special type of random variable. Its density curve has a distinctive bell shape, and it is fully defined by two values: (1) the mean or expected value of the random variable, \\(\\mu\\), which is located on the X-axis at the center of the density curve (its highest point), and (2) the standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), which reflects the dispersion of the random variable; the greater the standard deviation is the wider the curve appears. In Figure 36.2, we can see the density curves of three random variables, all following normal distributions: The solid line represents a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) &amp; \\(\\sigma = 2\\). The dotted line represents a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 5\\) &amp; \\(\\sigma = 5\\). The dashed line represents a normal distribution with \\(\\mu = 15\\) &amp; \\(\\sigma = 2\\). Figure 36.2: Three normal distributions. A random variable that follows a normal distribution can take any values in the real line, but those values (on the X-axis) that correspond to the peak of the density curve are more likely than those corresponding to the tails. The density curve drawn with a solid line has the same mean as the one drawn with a dotted line, \\(\\mu = 5\\), but the former exhibits less dispersion, measured by the standard deviation \\(\\sigma =2\\), than the latter, \\(\\sigma = 5\\). Since the total area under any density curve is equal to 1, the wider curve has to be shorter in height to preserve this property. On the other hand, the density curve drawn with a solid line has the same standard deviation as the one drawn with a dashed line, \\(\\sigma = 2\\), but the latter has a greater mean, \\(\\mu = 15\\), than the former, \\(\\mu = 5\\), so they do look the same but the latter is centered farther to the right on the X-axis than the former. The standard normal distribution A special normal distribution has mean \\(\\mu\\) = 0 and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) = 1. It is called the standard normal distribution, and it is represented by a density curve called the \\(z\\)-curve. If a random variable \\(Z\\) follows the standard normal distribution, a realization of this random variable is called a standard value or \\(z\\)-value. The \\(z\\)-value also represents the number of standard deviations above the mean, if positive, or below the mean, if negative. For example, if \\(z=5\\), the value observed represents a realization of the random variable \\(Z\\) that is five standard deviations above the mean, \\(\\mu = 0\\). Linear transformations of random variables that follow the normal distribution A linear transformation of a random variable transforms the original variable into a new random variable by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing constants to the original values. The resulting random variable could have a different mean and standard deviation. The most interesting transformation is turning a random variable into another with \\(\\mu = 0\\) and \\(\\sigma = 1\\). When this happens we say that the random variable has been standardized. A property of the normal distribution is that any linear transformation of a random variable that follows the normal distribution results in a new random variable that also follows a normal distribution, potentially with different mean and standard deviation. In particular, we can turn any random variable that follows the normal distribution into a random variable that follows the standard normal distribution. For example, if a value \\(x = 11\\) comes from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu =5\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 2\\), the \\(z\\)-value \\[z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{11 - 5}{2} = 3\\] is the corresponding value in a standard normal curve. Moreover, we have determined that \\(x = 11\\) for this example is precisely \\(3\\) standard deviations above the mean. Finding probabilities under a density curve When a random variable can be represented by a density curve, the probability that the random variable takes a value in any given interval (on the X-axis) is equal to the area under the density curve for that interval. If we know the equation that represents the density curve, we could use the mathematical technique from calculus known as integration to determine this area. In the case of the normal curve, the integral for any interval does not have a close-form solution, and the solution is calculated using numerical approximations. Let’s assume that a random variable \\(Z\\) follows a standard normal distribution. We would like to know how likely it is for this random variable to take a value that is within one standard deviation from the mean. Equivalently, what is the probability that the observed value \\(z\\) (in the X-axis) is between -1 and 1 as shown in Figure 36.3? Figure 36.3: Normal area within one standard deviation. Calculations show that this area is 0.6827 (68.27%) of the total area under the curve. This is equivalent to saying that the probability of getting a value between \\(-1\\) and 1 on a standard normal is 68.27%. This also means that if a random variable representing an experiment follows a normal distribution, the probability that the outcome of this experiment is within one standard deviation from the mean is 68.27%. Similarly, the area under the standard normal density curve between -2 and 2 is shown in Figure 36.4. Figure 36.4: Normal area within two standard deviations. Calculations show that this area is equal to 0.9545 or 95.45%. If a random variable representing an experiment follows a normal distribution, the probability that the outcome of this experiment is within two standard deviations from the mean is 95.45%. It is also common practice to use the exact number of standard deviations that correspond to an area around the mean exactly equal to 95% (instead of 95.45%). Please see Appendix A online to produce these or other calculations in R. The result is that the area under the density curve around the mean that is exactly equal to 0.95, or 95%, is the area within 1.96 standard deviation from the mean. Remember this number, as it will be used a few times in later sections. In summary, if the possible outcomes of an experiment can be expressed as a random variable that follows the normal distribution, the probability of getting a result that is within one standard deviation from the mean is about 68.27%, within 2 standard deviations form the mean is 95.45%, within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean is 95%, and within 3 standard deviations from the mean is about 99.73%, to name a few. Spend a few moments grasping this idea; observe, for example, that it is almost impossible to observe an outcome represented by a number that is five standard deviations above the mean as the chances of that happening are near zero. We are now ready to return to our main goal: how to find an interval estimate of the population mean based on a single sample. 36.1.3 The confidence interval Let’s continue using the example where we try to estimate the population mean weight of almonds with a random sample of 100 almonds. We saw in the last module that the sampling distribution of the sample mean weight of almonds approximates a normal distribution with expected value equal to the population mean weight of almonds and a standard error equal to \\[SE(\\bar x) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt {100}}.\\] In Subsection 36.1.1 we showed that for the population of almonds, \\(\\mu =3.645\\) grams and \\(\\sigma = 0.392\\), so the standard error for the sampling distribution is \\[SE(\\bar x) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{0.392}{\\sqrt{100}} = 0.039\\] grams. In Figure 36.5 we plot the density curve for this distribution using these values. Figure 36.5: Normal density curve for the sample mean weight of almonds. The horizontal axis (X-axis) represents the sample means that we can determine from all the possible random samples of 100 almonds. The red dot represents the expected value of the sampling distribution, \\(\\mu = 3.64\\), located on the X-axis at the center of the distribution. The density curve’s height can be thought of as how likely those sample means are to be observed. For example, it is more likely to get a random sample with a sample mean around \\(3.645\\) grams (which corresponds to the highest point of the curve) than it is to get a sample with a sample mean of around \\(3.5\\) grams, since the curve’s height is almost zero at that value. The blue dot is the sample mean from our sample of 100 almonds, \\(\\overline{x} = 3.682\\) grams. It is located 0.037 grams above the population mean weight. How far is 0.037 grams? It is helpful to express this distance in standardized values: \\[\\frac{3.682 - 3.645}{0.039} = 0.945\\] so 0.037 more grams is about 0.945 standard errors above the population mean. In real-life situations, the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), is unknown so the distance from the sample mean to \\(\\mu\\) is also unknown. On the other hand, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows a normal distribution. Based on our earlier discussion about areas under the normal curve, there is a 95% chance that the value observed is within 1.96 standard deviations from the mean. In the context of our problem, there is a 95% chance that the sample mean weight is within 1.96 standard errors from the population mean weight. As shown earlier, the sample mean calculated in our example was 0.945 standard errors above the population mean, well within the reasonable range. Think about this result. If we were to take a different random sample of 100 almonds, the sample mean will likely be different, but you still have a 95% chance that the new sample mean will be within 1.96 standard errors from the population mean. We can finally construct an interval estimate that takes advantage of this configuration. We center our interval at the sample mean observed and then extend to each side the magnitude equivalent to 1.96 standard errors. The lower and upper bounds of this interval are: \\[\\begin{aligned}\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) &amp;= \\left(3.682 - 1.96 \\cdot \\frac{0.392}{\\sqrt{100}},\\quad 3.682 + 1.96 \\cdot \\frac{0.392}{\\sqrt{100}}\\right)\\\\ &amp;= (3.605, 3.759)\\end{aligned}\\] Here is R code that can be used to calculate these lower and upper bounds: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize( sample_mean = mean(weight), lower_bound = mean(weight) - 1.96 * sigma / sqrt(length(weight)), upper_bound = mean(weight) + 1.96 * sigma / sqrt(length(weight)) ) # A tibble: 1 × 4 replicate sample_mean lower_bound upper_bound &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 3.60515 3.75885 The functions mean() and length() find the sample mean weight and sample size, respectively, from the sample of almonds’ weights in almonds_sample_100. The number 1.96 corresponds to the number of standard errors needed to get a 95% area under the normal distribution and sd(weight) calculates the sigma value that we discussed earlier. Figure 36.6 shows this interval as a horizontal blue line. Observe how the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is part of this interval. Figure 36.6: Is the population mean in the interval? Since 1.96 standard errors were used on the construction of this interval, we call this a 95% confidence interval. A confidence interval can be viewed as an interval estimator of the population mean. Compare an interval estimator with the sample mean that is a point estimator. The latter estimates the parameter with a single number, the former provides an entire interval to account for the location of the parameter. An apt analogy involves fishing. Imagine that there is a single fish swimming in murky water. The fish is not visible but its movement produces ripples on the surface that can provide some limited information about the fish’s location. To capture the fish, one could use a spear or a net. Because the information is limited, throwing the spear at the ripples may capture the fish but likely will miss it. Throwing a net around the ripples, on the other hand, may give a much higher likelihood of capturing the fish. Using the sample mean only to estimate the population mean is like throwing a spear at the ripples in the hopes of capturing the fish. Constructing a confidence interval that may include the population mean is like throwing a net to surround the ripples. Keep this analogy in mind, as we will revisit it in later sections. 36.1.4 The t distribution Remember that due to the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean was approximately normal with mean equal to the population mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation given by the standard error \\(SE(\\overline X) = \\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). We can standardize this for any sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) such that \\[z = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\] is the corresponding value of the standard normal distribution. In the construction of the interval in Figure 36.6 we have assumed the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), was known, and therefore we have used it to find the confidence interval. Nevertheless, in real-life applications, the population standard deviation is also unknown. Instead, we use the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), from the sample we have, as an estimator of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Our estimated standard error is given by \\[\\widehat{SE}(\\overline X) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt n}.\\] When using the sample standard deviation to estimate the standard error, we are introducing additional uncertainty in our model. For example, if we try to standardize this value, we get \\[t = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}}.\\] Because we are using the sample standard deviation in this equation and since the sample standard deviation changes from sample to sample, the additional uncertainty makes the values \\(t\\) no longer normal. Instead they follow a new distribution called the \\(t\\) distribution. The \\(t\\) distribution is similar to the standard normal; its density curve is also bell-shaped, and it is symmetric around zero, but the tails of the \\(t\\) distribution are a little thicker than those of the standard normal. In addition, the \\(t\\) distribution requires one additional parameter, the degrees of freedom. For sample mean problems, the degrees of freedom needed are exactly \\(n-1\\), the size of the sample minus one. Figure 36.7 shows the density curves of the standard normal density curve, in black, a \\(t\\) density curve for a t distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, in dotted blue, and a \\(t\\) density curve for a t distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, in dashed red. Figure 36.7: The standard normal and two t-distributions. Observe how the \\(t\\) density curve in dashed red (\\(t\\) with 10 degrees of freedom) gets closer to the standard normal density curve, or \\(z\\)-curve, in solid black, than the \\(t\\) curve in dotted blue (\\(t\\) with 2 degrees of freedom). The greater the number of degrees of freedom, the closer the \\(t\\) density curve is from the \\(z\\) curve. This change makes our calculations slightly different. Please see Appendix A online for calculations of probabilities for \\(t\\) density curves with different degrees of freedom. Using that knowledge, the calculation for our specific example shows that 95% of the sample means are within 1.98 standard errors from the population mean weight. The number of standard errors needed is not that different from before, 1.98 versus 1.96, because the degrees of freedom are fairly large. Using this information, we can construct the 95% confidence interval based entirely on our sample information and using the sample mean and sample standard deviation. We calculate those values again for almonds_sample_100: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), sample_sd = sd(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 3 replicate sample_mean sample_sd &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 0.362199 Observe that the sample standard deviation is \\(s = 0.362\\) which is not that different from the population standard deviation of \\(\\sigma = 0.392\\). We again center the confidence interval at the observed sample mean but now extend the interval by 1.98 standard errors to each side. The lower and upper bounds of this confidence interval are: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(\\overline{x} - 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) &amp;= \\left(3.682 - 1.98 \\cdot \\frac{0.362}{\\sqrt{100}}, 3.682 + 1.98 \\cdot \\frac{0.362}{\\sqrt{100}}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= (3.498, 3.846)) \\end{aligned} \\] We can also compute these lower and upper bounds: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), sample_sd = sd(weight), lower_bound = mean(weight) - 1.98*sd(weight)/sqrt(length(weight)), upper_bound = mean(weight) + 1.98*sd(weight)/sqrt(length(weight))) # A tibble: 1 × 5 replicate sample_mean sample_sd lower_bound upper_bound &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 0.362199 3.61028 3.75372 The confidence interval computed here, using the sample standard deviation and a \\(t\\) distribution, is almost the same as the one attained using the population standard deviation and the standard normal distribution, the difference is about 0.005 units for the upper and lower bound. This happens because with a sample size of 100, the \\(t\\)-curve and \\(z\\)-curve are almost identical and also because the sample standard deviation was very similar to the population standard deviation. This does not have to be always the case and occasionally we can observe greater differences; but, in general, the results are fairly similar. More importantly, the confidence interval constructed here contains the population mean of \\(\\mu = 3.645\\), which is the result we needed. Recall that a confidence interval is an interval estimate of the parameter of interest, the population mean weight of almonds. Let’s summarize the results so far: If the size used for your random sample is large enough, the sampling distribution of the sample mean follows, approximately, the normal distribution. Using the sample mean observed and the standard error of the sampling distribution, we can construct 95% confidence intervals for the population mean. The formula for these intervals (where \\(n\\) is the sample size used) is given by \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right).\\] When the population standard deviation is unknown (which is almost always the case), the sample standard deviation is used to estimate the standard error. This produces additional variability and the standardized values follow a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. The formula for 95% confidence intervals when the sample size is \\(n=100\\) is given by \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{100}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{100}}\\right).\\] The method to construct 95% confidence intervals guarantees that in the long-run for 95% of the possible samples, the intervals determined will include the population mean. It also guarantees that 5% of the possible samples will lead to intervals that do not include the population mean. As we have constructed intervals with a 95% level of confidence, we can construct intervals with any level of confidence. The only change in the equations will be the number of standard errors needed. 36.1.5 Interpreting confidence intervals We have used the sample almonds_sample_100, constructed a 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of almonds, and showed that the interval contained this population. This result is not surprising as we expect intervals such as this to include the population mean for 95% of the possible random samples. We repeat this interval construction for many random samples. Figure 36.8 presents the results for one hundred 95% confidence intervals. Figure 36.8: One hundred 95% confidence intervals and whether the population mean is captured in each. Note that each interval was built using a different random sample. The red vertical line is drawn at the location of the population mean weight, \\(\\mu = 3.645\\). The horizontal lines represent the one hundred 95% confidence intervals found. The gray confidence intervals cross the red vertical line so they contain the population mean. The black confidence intervals do not. This result motivates the meaning of a 95% confidence interval: If you could construct intervals using the procedure described earlier for every possible random sample, then 95% of these intervals will include the population mean and 5% of them will not. Of course, in most situations, it would be impractical or impossible to take every possible random sample. Still, for a large number of random samples, this result is approximately correct. In Figure 36.8, for example, 5 out of 100 confidence intervals do not include the population mean, and 95% do. It won’t always match up perfectly like this, but the proportions should match pretty close to the confidence level chosen. The term “95% confidence” might make us think we are talking about probabilities or chances. We are, but in a subtle way that might not come to mind at first. Before a random sample has been procured, there is a 95% chance that when a confidence interval is constructed using the prospective random sample, this interval will contain the population mean. The moment a random sample has been attained, the interval constructed either contains the population mean or it does not; with certainty, there is no longer a chance involved. This is true even if we do not know what the population mean is. So the 95% confidence refers to the method or process to be used on a prospective sample. We are confident that if we follow the process to construct the interval, 95% of the time the random sample attained will lead us to produce an interval that contains the population mean. On the other hand, it would be improper to say that… “there is a 95% chance that the confidence interval contains the population mean.” Looking at Figure 36.8, each of the confidence intervals either does or does not contain \\(\\mu\\). Once the confidence interval is determined, either the population mean is included or not. In the literature, this explanation has been encapsulated in a short-hand version: we are 95% confident that the interval contains the population parameter. For example, in Subsection 36.1.4 the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of almonds was (3.498, 3.846), and we would say: “We are 95% confident that the population mean weight of almonds is between 3.498 and 3.846 grams.” It is perfectly acceptable to use the short-hand statement, but always remember that the 95% confidence refers to the process, or method, and can be thought of as a chance or probability only before the random sample has been acquired. To further ensure that the probability-type of language is not misused, quotation marks are sometimes put around “95% confident” to emphasize that it is a short-hand version of the more accurate explanation. Understanding the width of a confidence interval A confidence interval is an estimator of a population parameter. In the case of the almonds’ bowl we constructed a confidence interval for the population mean. The equation to construct a 95% confidence interval was \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\] Observe that the confidence interval is centered at the sample mean and it extends to each side 1.96 standard errors \\(1.96\\cdot \\sigma / \\sqrt{n}\\). This quantity is exactly half the width of your confidence interval, and it is called the margin of error. The value of the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\), is beyond our control, as it is determined by the distribution of the experiment or phenomenon studied. The sample mean, \\(\\overline{x}\\), is a result that depends on your random sample exclusively. On the other hand, the number 1.96 and the sample size, \\(n\\), are values that can be changed by the researcher or practitioner. They play an important role on the width of the confidence interval. We study each of them separately. The confidence level We mentioned earlier that the number 1.96 relates to a 95% confidence process but we did not show how to determine this value. The level of confidence is a decision of the practitioner. If you want to be more confident, say 98% or 99% confident, you just need to adjust the appropriate number of standard errors needed. We show how to determine this number, and use Figure 36.9 to illustrate this process. If the confidence level is 0.95 (or 95%), the area in the middle of the standard normal distribution is 0.95. This area is shaded in Figure 36.9. We construct \\(\\alpha = 1 - \\text{confidence level} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\\). Think of \\(\\alpha\\) as the total area on both tails. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the area on each tail is \\(\\alpha/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025\\). We need the exact number of standard deviations that produces the shaded area. Since the center of a standard normal density curve is zero, as shown in Figure 36.9, and the normal curve is symmetric, the number of standard deviations can be represented by \\(-q\\) and \\(q\\), the same magnitude but one positive and the other negative. Figure 36.9: Normal curve with the shaded middle area being 0.95 In R, the function qnorm() finds the value of \\(q\\) when the area under this curve to the left of this value \\(q\\) is given. In our example the area to the left of \\(-q\\) is \\(\\alpha/2 = 0.05/2 = 0.025\\), so qnorm(0.025) [1] -1.96 or 1.96 standard deviation below the mean. Similarly, the total area under the curve to the left of \\(q\\) is the total shaded area, 0.95, plus the small white area on the left tail, \\(0.025\\), and \\(0.95 + 0.025 = 0.975\\), so qnorm(0.975) [1] 1.96 That is the reason we use 1.96 standard deviation when calculating 95% confidence intervals. What if we want to retrieve a 90% confidence interval? We follow the same procedure: The confidence level is 0.90. \\(\\alpha = 1 - \\text{confidence level} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10\\). The area on each tail is \\(\\alpha/2 = 0.10/2 = 0.05\\). The area needed to find \\(q\\) is \\(0.90+0.05 = 0.95\\). qnorm(0.95) [1] 1.65 If we want to determine a 90% confidence interval, we need to use 1.645 standard errors in our calculations. We can update the R code to calculate the lower and upper bounds of a 90% confidence interval: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), lower_bound = mean(weight) - qnorm(0.95)*sigma/sqrt(length(weight)), upper_bound = mean(weight) + qnorm(0.95)*sigma/sqrt(length(weight))) # A tibble: 1 × 4 replicate sample_mean lower_bound upper_bound &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.682 3.61751 3.74649 Let’s do one more. If we want an 80% confidence interval, \\(1 - 0.8 = 0.2\\), \\(0.2/2 = 0.1\\), and \\(0.8+0.1 = 0.9\\), so qnorm(0.9) [1] 1.28 When you want to calculate an 80%, 90%, or 95% confidence interval, you need to construct your interval using 1.282, 1.645, or 1.96 standard errors, respectively. The more confident you want to be, the larger the number of standard errors you need to use, and the wider your confidence interval becomes. But a confidence interval is an estimator of the population mean, the narrower it is, the more useful it is for practical reasons. So there is a trade-off between the width of a confidence interval and the confidence you want to have. The sample size As we studied changes to the confidence level, we can determine how big is the random sample used. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is \\[1.96\\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}.\\] If the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases proportional to the square root of the sample size. For example, if we secure a random sample of size 25, \\(1/\\sqrt{25} = 0.2\\), and if we draw a sample of size 100, \\(1/\\sqrt{100} = 0.1\\). By choosing a larger sample size, four times larger, we produce a confidence interval that is half the width. This result is worth considering. A confidence interval is an estimator of the parameter of interest, such as the population mean weight of almonds. Ideally, we would like to build a confidence interval with a high level of confidence, for example, 95% confidence. But we also want an interval that is narrow enough to provide useful information. For example, assume we get the following 95% confidence intervals for the population mean weight of almonds: between 2 and 4 grams, or between 3.51 and 3.64 grams, or between 3.539 and 3.545 grams. The first interval does not seem useful at all, the second works better, and the third is tremendously accurate, as we are 95% confident that the population mean is within 0.006 grams. Obviously, we always prefer narrower intervals, but there are trade-offs we need to consider. We always prefer high levels of confidence, but the more confident we want to be the wider the interval will be. In addition, the larger the random sample used, the narrower the confidence interval will be. Using a large sample is always a preferred choice, but the trade-offs are often external; collecting large samples could be expensive and time-consuming. The construction of confidence intervals needs to take into account all these considerations. We’ve now concluded the theory-based approach to construct confidence intervals. In the next section we’ll explore a completely different approach to construct confidence intervals, and in later sections we will make comparisons of these methods. 36.2 Estimation with the bootstrap In 1979, Brad Efron published an article introducing a method called the bootstrap that is next summarized. A random sample of size \\(n\\) is taken from the population. This sample is used to find another sample, with replacement, also of size \\(n\\). This is called resampling with replacement and the resulting sample is called a bootstrap sample. For example, if the original sample is \\(\\{4,2,5,4,1,3,7,4,6,1\\}\\), one particular bootstrap sample could be \\(\\{6, 4, 7, 4, 2, 7, 2, 5, 4, 1\\}.\\) Notice that the number 7 appears once in the original sample, but twice in the bootstrap sample; similarly, the number 3 in the original sample does not appear in the bootstrap sample. This is not uncommon for a bootstrap sample, some of the numbers in the original sample are repeated and others are not included. The basic idea of the bootstrap is to gain a large number of bootstrap samples, all drawn from the same original sample. Then, we use all these bootstrap samples to find estimates of population parameters, standard errors, or even the density curve of the population. Using them we can construct confidence intervals, perform hypothesis testing, and other inferential methods. This method takes advantage of the large number of bootstrap samples that can be determined. In several respects, this exercise is not different from the sampling distribution explained in the last module. The only difference, albeit an important one, is that we are not sampling from the population, we are sampling from the original sample. How many different bootstrap samples could we get from a single sample? A very large number, actually. If the original sample has 10 numbers, as the one shown above, each possible bootstrap sample of size 10 is determined by sampling 10 times with replacement, so the total number of bootstrap samples is \\(10^{10}\\) or 10 billion different bootstrap samples. If the original sample has 20 numbers, the number of bootstrap samples is \\(20^{20}\\), a number greater than the total number of stars in the universe. Even with modern powerful computers, it would be an onerous task to calculate every possible bootstrap sample. Instead, a thousand or so bootstrap samples are retrieved, similar to the sampling simulations we previously performed, and this number is often large enough to provide useful results. Ever since Efron proposed the bootstrap, the statistical community embraced this method. During the 1980s and 1990s, many theoretical and empirical results were presented showing the strength of bootstrap methods. A number of statisticians showed that bootstrapping was at least as good if not better than existing methods for estimating the standard error of an estimator or finding the confidence intervals of a parameter. Modifications were proposed to improve the algorithm in situations where the basic method was not producing accurate results. With the continuous improvement of computing power and speed, and the advantages of having ready-to-use statistical software for its implementation, the use of the bootstrap has become more and more popular in many fields. As an illustration, if we are interested in the mean of the population, \\(\\mu\\), and we have collected one random sample, we can gain a large number of bootstrap samples from this original sample, use them to calculate sample means, order the sample means from smallest to largest, and choose the interval that contains the middle 95% of these sample means. This will be the simplest way to find a confidence interval based on the bootstrap. In the next few subsections, we explore how to incorporate this and similar methods to construct confidence intervals. 36.2.1 Bootstrap samples: revisiting the almond activity To study and understand the behavior of bootstrap samples, we return to our example of the chocolate-covered almonds in a bowl. Recall that the bowl is considered the population of almonds, and we are interested in estimating the population mean weight of almonds. As we did before, we only have access to a single random sample. In this section, we use the data frame almonds_sample_100, a random sample of 100 almonds taken earlier. We call this the original sample, and it is used in this section to create the bootstrap samples. The first 10 rows are shown: almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 166 4.2 2 1 1215 4.2 3 1 1899 3.9 4 1 1912 3.8 5 1 4637 3.3 6 1 511 3.5 7 1 127 4 8 1 4419 3.5 9 1 4729 4.2 10 1 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows Constructing a bootstrap sample: resampling once We start by constructing one bootstrap sample of 100 almonds from the original sample of 100 almonds. These are the steps needed to perform this task manually: Step 1: Place the original sample of 100 almonds into a bag or hat. Step 2: Mix the bag contents, draw one almond, weigh it, and record the weight as seen in Figure 36.10. Figure 36.10: Step 2: Weighing one almond at random. Step 3: Put the almond back into the bag! In other words, replace it as seen in Figure 36.11. Figure 36.11: Step 3: Replacing almond. Step 4: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 a total of 99 more times, resulting in 100 weights. These steps describe resampling with replacement, and the resulting sample is called a bootstrap sample. This procedure results in some almonds being chosen more than once and other almonds not being chosen at all. Resampling with replacement induces sampling variation, so every bootstrap sample can be different than any other. This activity can be performed manually following the steps described above. We can also take advantage of the R code we reviewed when discussing sampling and do this virtually. The data frame almonds_sample_100 contains the random sample of almonds taken from the population. We show selected rows from this sample. almonds_sample_100 &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; select(-replicate) almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 2 ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 166 4.2 2 1215 4.2 3 1899 3.9 4 1912 3.8 5 4637 3.3 6 511 3.5 7 127 4 8 4419 3.5 9 4729 4.2 10 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows We use ungroup() and select to eliminate the variable replicate from the almonds_sample_100 as this variable may create clutter when resampling. We can now create a bootstrap sample also of size 100 by resampling with replacement once. boot_sample &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1) We used this type of R syntax many times when sampling. We first select the data frame almonds_sample_100 that contains the almonds’ weights in the original sample. We then perform resampling with replacement once: we resample by using rep_sample_n(), a sample of size 100 by setting size = 100, with replacement by adding the argument replace = TRUE, and one time by setting reps = 1. The object boot_sample is a bootstrap sample of 100 almonds’ weights gained from the original sample of 100 almonds’ weights. We show the first ten rows of boot_sample: boot_sample # A tibble: 100 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 2105 3.1 2 1 4529 3.8 3 1 1146 4.2 4 1 2993 3.2 5 1 1535 3.2 6 1 2294 3.7 7 1 438 3.8 8 1 4419 3.5 9 1 1674 3.5 10 1 1146 4.2 # ℹ 90 more rows We can also study some of the characteristics of this bootstrap sample, such as its sample mean: boot_sample |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 replicate mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.702 By using summarize() and mean() on the bootstrap sample boot_sample, we determine that the mean weight is 3.702 grams. Recall that the sample mean of the original sample was found in the previous subsection as 3.682. So, the sample mean of the bootstrap sample is different than the sample mean of the original sample. This variation is induced by resampling with replacement, the method for finding the bootstrap sample. We can also compare the histogram of weights for the bootstrap sample with the histogram of weights for the original sample. ggplot(boot_sample, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Resample of 100 weights&quot;) ggplot(almonds_sample_100, aes(x = weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Original sample of 100 weights&quot;) Figure 36.12: Comparing weight in the resampled boot_sample with the original sample almonds_sample_100. Observe in Figure 36.12 that while the general shapes of both distributions of weights are roughly similar, they are not identical. This is the typical behavior of bootstrap samples. They are samples that have been determined from the original sample, but because replacement is used before each new observation is attained, some values often appear more than once while others often do not appear at all. Many bootstrap samples: resampling multiple times In this subsection, we’ll take full advantage of resampling with replacement by taking many bootstrap samples and study relevant information, such as the variability of their sample means. We can start by using the R syntax we used before, this time for 35 replications. bootstrap_samples_35 &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 35) bootstrap_samples_35 # A tibble: 3,500 × 3 # Groups: replicate [35] replicate ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 1459 3.6 2 1 2972 3.4 3 1 1215 4.2 4 1 1381 3.4 5 1 1264 3.5 6 1 199 3.4 7 1 476 3.8 8 1 4806 3.7 9 1 3169 4.1 10 1 2265 3.4 # ℹ 3,490 more rows The syntax is the same as before, but this time we set reps = 35 to get 35 bootstrap samples. The resulting data frame, bootstrap_samples, has 35 \\(\\cdot\\) 100 = 3500 rows corresponding to 35 resamples of 100 almonds’ weights. Let’s now compute the resulting 35 sample means using the same dplyr code as we did in the previous section: boot_means &lt;- bootstrap_samples_35 |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) boot_means # A tibble: 35 × 2 replicate mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 25 more rows Observe that boot_means has 35 rows, corresponding to the 35 bootstrap sample means. Furthermore, observe that the values of mean_weight vary as shown in Figure 36.13. ggplot(boot_means, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;sample mean weight in grams&quot;) Figure 36.13: Distribution of 35 sample means from 35 bootstrap samples. This histogram highlights the variation of the sample mean weights. Since we have only used 35 bootstrap samples, the histogram looks a little coarse. To improve our perception of this variation, we find 1000 bootstrap samples and their sample means: # Retrieve 1000 bootstrap samples bootstrap_samples &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) # Compute sample means from the bootstrap samples boot_means &lt;- bootstrap_samples |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) We can combine these two operations into a single chain of pipe (|&gt;) operators: boot_means &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) boot_means # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate mean_weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 990 more rows The data frame boot_means contains 1000 sample mean weights. Each is calculated from a different bootstrap sample and visualized in Figure 36.14. ggplot(boot_means, aes(x = mean_weight)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, color = &quot;white&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;sample mean weight in grams&quot;) Figure 36.14: Histogram of 1000 bootstrap sample mean weights of almonds. The histogram is a graphical approximation of the bootstrap distribution of the sample mean. This distribution is constructed by getting all the sample means from every bootstrap sample constructed based on the original sample. Since the total number of possible bootstraps is really large, we have not used all of them here, but 1000 of them already provides a good visual approximation. Observe also that the bootstrap distribution itself can approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean, a concept we studied the last module, where we took multiple samples from the population. The key difference here is that we resample from a single sample, the original sample, not from the entire population. By inspecting the histogram in Figure 36.14, the bell-shape is apparent. We can also approximate the center and the spread of this distribution by computing the mean and the standard deviation of these 1000 bootstrap sample means: boot_means |&gt; summarize(mean_of_means = mean(mean_weight), sd_of_means = sd(mean_weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 mean_of_means sd_of_means &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.67998 0.0356615 Everything we learned when studying the sampling distribution of the sample mean applies here. For example, observe that the mean of these bootstrap sample means is near 3.68 grams, very close to the mean of the original sample: 3.682 grams. Our intention is not to study the distribution of the bootstrap samples, but rather to use them to estimate population values, such as the population mean. In the next section, we discuss how can we use these bootstrap samples to construct confidence intervals. 36.2.2 Confidence intervals and the bootstrap: original workflow The process of determining bootstrap samples and using them for estimation is called bootstrapping. We can estimate population parameters such as the mean, median, or standard deviation. We can also construct confidence intervals. In this subsection, let’s focus on the latter and construct confidence intervals based on bootstrap samples. For this, we review the R syntax and workflow we have already used in previous sections and also introduce a new package: the infer package for tidy and transparent statistical inference. Original workflow Recall that we took bootstrap samples, then calculated the sample means from these samples. Let’s revisit the original workflow using dplyr verbs and the |&gt; operator. First, we’ll use rep_sample_n() to resample from the original sample almonds_sample_100 of 25 almonds. Let’s set size = 100 to generate bootstrap samples of the same size as the original sample, and we resample with replacement by setting replace = TRUE. We’ll create 1000 bootstrap samples by setting reps = 1000: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) Second, let’s add another pipe followed by summarize() to compute the sample mean() weight for each replicate: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000) |&gt; summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) For this simple case, all we needed was to use the rep_sample_n() function and a dplyr verb. However, using only dplyr verbs provides us with a limited set of tools that is not ideal when working with more complicated situations. This is the reason we introduce the infer package. 36.2.3 The infer package workflow: The infer package is an R package for statistical inference. It makes efficient use of the |&gt; pipe operator we introduced in Section 18.2.1 to spell out the sequence of steps necessary to perform statistical inference in a “tidy” and transparent fashion. Just as the dplyr package provides functions with verb-like names to perform data wrangling, the infer package provides functions with intuitive verb-like names to perform statistical inference, such as constructing confidence intervals or performing hypothesis testing. We have discussed the theory-based implementation of the former in section 36.1.3 and we’ll introduce the latter when we discuss hypothesis testing in the next module. Using the example of almonds’ weights, let’s introduce inferby comparing its implementation with dplyr. Remember that to calculate a sample statistic or point estimate from a sample, such as the sample mean, when using dplyr we use summarize() and mean(): almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(stat = mean(weight)) If we want to use infer instead, we use the functions specify() and calculate() as shown: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) The new structure using infer seems slightly more complicated than the one using dplyr for this simple calculation. However, these functions will provide three chief benefits moving forward. First, the infer verb names better align with the overall simulation-based framework you need to understand to construct confidence intervals and to conduct hypothesis tests (in the next module). Second, you can jump back and forth seamlessly between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing with minimal changes to your code. This will become clear in the next module, when we’ll compare the infer code for both of these inferential methods. Third, the infer workflow is much simpler for conducting inference when you have more than one variable. Later, we’ll look at two-sample inference where the sample data is collected from two groups, and this will come in handy there. Let’s now illustrate the sequence of verbs necessary to construct a confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\), the population mean weight of almonds. 1. specify variables Figure 36.15: Diagram of the specify() verb. As shown in Figure 36.15, the specify() function is used to choose which variables in a data frame are the focus of our statistical inference. We do this by specifying the response argument. For example, in our almonds_sample_100 data frame of the 100 almonds sampled from the bowl, the variable of interest is weight: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 100 × 1 weight &lt;dbl&gt; 1 4.2 2 4.2 3 3.9 4 3.8 5 3.3 6 3.5 7 4 8 3.5 9 4.2 10 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows Notice how the data itself does not change, but the Response: weight (numeric) meta-data does. This is similar to how the group_by() verb from dplyr doesn’t change the data, but only adds “grouping” meta-data, as we saw in Section 24.3. We can also specify which variables are the focus of the study by introducing a formula = y ~ x in specify(). This is the same formula notation you saw when first working with regression models: the response variable y is separated from the explanatory variable x by a ~ (“tilde”). The following use of specify() with the formula argument yields the same result seen previously: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(formula = weight ~ NULL) In the case of almonds, we only have a response variable and no explanatory variable of interest. Thus, we set the x on the right-hand side of the ~ to be NULL. In cases where inference is focused on a single sample, as it is the almonds’ weights example, either specification works. In the examples we present in later sections, the formula specification is simpler and more flexible. 2. generate replicates Figure 36.16: Diagram of generate() replicates. After we specify() the variables of interest, we pipe the results into the generate() function to generate replicates. This is the function that produces the bootstrap samples or performs the similar resampling process a large number of times, based on the variable(s) specified previously, as shown in Figure 36.16. Recall we did this 1000 times. The generate() function’s first argument is reps, which sets the number of replicates we would like to generate. Since we want to resample the 100 almonds in almonds_sample_100 with replacement 1000 times, we set reps = 1000. The second argument type determines the type of computer simulation used. Setting this to type = \"bootstrap\" produces bootstrap samples using resampling with replacement. We’ll see different options for type in a later walkthrough. almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 100,000 × 2 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.6 2 1 3.4 3 1 4.2 4 1 3.4 5 1 3.5 6 1 3.4 7 1 3.8 8 1 3.7 9 1 4.1 10 1 3.4 # ℹ 99,990 more rows Notice that the resulting data frame has 100,000 rows. This is because we have found 1000 bootstrap samples, each with 100 rows. The variable replicate indicates the bootstrap sample each row belongs to, from 1 to 1000, each replicate repeated 100 times. The default value of the type argument is \"bootstrap\" in this scenario, so the inclusion was only made for completeness. If the last line was written simply as generate(reps = 1000), the result would be the same. Comparing with original workflow: Note that the steps of the infer workflow so far produce the same results as the original workflow using the rep_sample_n() function we saw earlier. In other words, the following two code chunks produce similar results: # infer workflow: # Original workflow: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, generate(reps = 1000) reps = 1000) 3. calculate summary statistics Figure 36.17: Diagram of calculate() summary statistics. After we generate() 1000 bootstrap samples, we want to summarize each of them, for example, by calculating the sample mean of each one of them. As Figure 36.17 shows, the calculate() function does this. In our example, we calculate the mean weight for each bootstrap sample by setting the stat argument equal to \"mean\" inside the calculate() function. The stat argument can be used for other common summary statistics such as \"median\", \"sum\", \"sd\" (standard deviation), and \"prop\" (proportion). To see a list of other possible summary statistics you can use, type ?calculate and read the help file. Let’s save the result in a data frame called bootstrap_means and explore its contents: bootstrap_means &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) Setting `type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;` in `generate()`. bootstrap_means Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that the resulting data frame has 1000 rows and 2 columns corresponding to the 1000 replicate values. It also has the mean weight for each bootstrap sample saved in the variable stat. Comparing with original workflow: You may have recognized at this point that the calculate() step in the infer workflow produces the same output as the summarize() step in the original workflow. # infer workflow: # Original workflow: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; rep_sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE, generate(reps = 1000) |&gt; reps = 1000) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) summarize(stat = mean(weight)) 4. visualize the results Figure 36.18: Diagram of visualize() results. The visualize() verb provides a quick way to visualize the bootstrap distribution as a histogram of the numerical stat variable’s values as shown in Figure 36.19. The pipeline of the main infer verbs used for exploring bootstrap distribution results is shown in Figure 36.18. visualize(bootstrap_means) Figure 36.19: Bootstrap distribution. Comparing with original workflow: In fact, visualize() is a wrapper function for the ggplot() function that uses a geom_histogram() layer. Recall that we illustrated the concept of a wrapper function in Figure 27.5 in Subsection 27.2.2. # infer workflow: # Original workflow: visualize(bootstrap_means) ggplot(bootstrap_means, aes(x = stat)) + geom_histogram() The visualize() function can take many other arguments to customize the plot further. In later sections, we’ll take advantage of this flexibility. In addition, it works with helper functions to add shading of the histogram values corresponding to the confidence interval values. We’ve now considered the different elements of the infer workflow for constructing a bootstrap distribution and visualizing it. A summary of these steps is presented in Figure 36.20. Figure 36.20: infer package workflow for confidence intervals. 36.2.4 Confidence intervals using bootstrap samples with infer Now, we’re ready to introduce confidence intervals using the bootstrap via infer. Let’s look at two different methods for constructing 95% confidence intervals as interval estimates of an unknown population parameter: the percentile method and the standard error method{Bootstrap!standard error method}. Let’s now check out the infer package code that explicitly constructs these. There are also some additional neat functions to visualize the resulting confidence intervals built-in to the infer package. Percentile method Recall that in Subsection 36.2.3, we generated 1000 bootstrap samples and stored them in data frame bootstrap_means: bootstrap_means Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 3.68 2 2 3.688 3 3 3.632 4 4 3.68 5 5 3.679 6 6 3.675 7 7 3.678 8 8 3.706 9 9 3.643 10 10 3.68 # ℹ 990 more rows The sample means stored in bootstrap_means represent a good approximation to the bootstrap distribution of all possible bootstrap samples. The percentile method for constructing 95% confidence intervals sets the lower endpoint of the confidence interval at the 2.5th percentile of bootstrap_means and similarly sets the upper endpoint at the 97.5th percentile. The resulting interval captures the middle 95% of the values of the sample mean weights of almonds in bootstrap_means. This is the interval estimate of the population mean weight of almonds in the entire bowl. We can compute the 95% confidence interval by piping bootstrap_means into the get_confidence_interval() function from the infer package, with the confidence level set to 0.95 and the confidence interval type to be \"percentile\". We save the results in percentile_ci. percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_means |&gt; get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) percentile_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61198 3.756 Alternatively, we can visualize the interval (3.61, 3.76) by piping the bootstrap_means data frame into the visualize() function and adding a shade_confidence_interval() layer. We set the endpoints argument to be percentile_ci. visualize(bootstrap_means) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci) Figure 36.21: Percentile method 95% confidence interval shaded corresponding to potential values. Notice in Figure 36.21 that 95% of the sample means stored in the stat variable in bootstrap_means fall between the two endpoints marked with the darker lines, with 2.5% of the sample means to the left of the shaded area and 2.5% of the sample means to the right. You also have the option to change the colors of the shading using the color and fill arguments. The infer package has incorporated a shorter named function shade_ci() that produces the same results. Try out the following code: visualize(bootstrap_means) + shade_ci(endpoints = percentile_ci, color = &quot;hotpink&quot;, fill = &quot;khaki&quot;) Standard error method In Subsection 36.1.3 we introduced theory-based confidence intervals. A 95% confidence interval can be constructed as \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\cdot SE(\\bar x), \\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\cdot SE(\\bar x)\\right)\\] where \\(\\overline{x}\\) is the sample mean of the original sample, 1.96 is the number of standard errors around the mean needed to account for 95% of the area under the density curve (when the distribution is normal), and \\(SE(\\bar x)\\) is the standard error of the sample mean that can be computed as \\(\\sigma /\\sqrt{n}\\) if the population standard deviation is known, or estimated as \\(s/\\sqrt{n}\\) if we have to use the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), and the sample size, \\(n\\). We can use the same structure to construct confidence intervals but using the bootstrap sample means to estimate the standard error of \\(\\overline{x}\\). Thus, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), using the standard error estimated via bootstrapping, \\(SE_\\text{boot}\\), is: \\[\\left(\\overline{x} - 1.96 \\cdot SE_{\\text{boot}}, \\quad \\overline{x} + 1.96 \\cdot SE_{\\text{boot}}\\right)\\] We can compute this confidence interval using dplyr. First, we calculate the estimated standard error: SE_boot &lt;- bootstrap_means |&gt; summarize(SE = sd(stat)) |&gt; pull(SE) SE_boot [1] 0.0357 and then use the original sample mean to calculate the 95% confidence interval: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(lower_bound = mean(weight) - 1.96 * SE_boot, upper_bound = mean(weight) + 1.96 * SE_boot) # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_bound upper_bound &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61210 3.75190 Alternatively, computation of the 95% confidence interval can once again be done via infer. Let’s find the sample mean of the original sample and store it in variable x_bar x_bar &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) x_bar Response: weight (numeric) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.682 Now, we can pipe the bootstrap_means data frame we created into the get_confidence_interval() function. We’ll set the type argument to be \"se\" and specify the point_estimate argument to be x_bar in order to set the center of the confidence interval to the sample mean of the original sample. standard_error_ci &lt;- bootstrap_means |&gt; get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = x_bar, level = 0.95) standard_error_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61210 3.75190 The results are the same whether dplyr or infer is used, but as explained earlier, the latter provides more flexibility for other tests. If we would like to visualize the interval (3.61, 3.75), we can once again pipe the bootstrap_means data frame into the visualize() function and add a shade_confidence_interval() layer to our plot. We set the endpoints argument to be standard_error_ci. The resulting standard-error method based on a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) can be seen in Figure 36.22. visualize(bootstrap_means) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = standard_error_ci) Figure 36.22: Standard-error method 95% confidence interval. Because we are using bootstrap samples to construct these intervals, we call the percentile and standard error methods simulation-based methods. We can compare the 95% confidence intervals from using both simulation-based methods as well as the one attained using the theory-based method described in 36.1.3: Percentile method: (3.61, 3.76) Standard error method: (3.61, 3.75) Theory-based method: (3.61, 3.76) 36.3 Case study: is yawning contagious? Let’s apply our knowledge of confidence intervals to answer the question: “Is yawning contagious?”. If you see someone else yawn, are you more likely to yawn? In an episode of the US show Mythbusters that aired on Discovery, the hosts conducted an experiment to answer this question. More information about the episode is available on IMDb. 36.3.1 Mythbusters study data Fifty adult participants who thought they were being considered for an appearance on the show were interviewed by a show recruiter. In the interview, the recruiter either yawned or did not. Participants then sat by themselves in a large van and were asked to wait. While in the van, the Mythbusters team watched the participants using a hidden camera to see if they yawned. The data frame containing the results of their experiment is available as mythbusters_yawn included in the moderndive package: mythbusters_yawn # A tibble: 50 × 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 seed yes 2 2 control yes 3 3 seed no 4 4 seed yes 5 5 seed no 6 6 control no 7 7 seed yes 8 8 control no 9 9 control no 10 10 seed no # ℹ 40 more rows The variables are: subj: The participant ID with values 1 through 50. group: A binary treatment variable indicating whether the participant was exposed to yawning. \"seed\" indicates the participant was exposed to yawning while \"control\" indicates the participant was not. yawn: A binary response variable indicating whether the participant ultimately yawned. Recall that you learned about treatment and response variables in our discussion on confounding variables. Let’s use some data wrangling to calculate counts of the four possible outcomes: mythbusters_yawn |&gt; group_by(group, yawn) |&gt; summarize(count = n(), .groups = &quot;keep&quot;) # A tibble: 4 × 3 # Groups: group, yawn [4] group yawn count &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 control no 12 2 control yes 4 3 seed no 24 4 seed yes 10 Let’s first focus on the \"control\" group participants who were not exposed to yawning. 12 such participants did not yawn, while 4 such participants did. So out of the 16 people who were not exposed to yawning, 4/16 = 0.25 = 25% did yawn. Let’s now focus on the \"seed\" group participants who were exposed to yawning where 24 such participants did not yawn, while 10 such participants did yawn. So out of the 34 people who were exposed to yawning, 10/34 = 0.294 = 29.4% did yawn. Comparing these two percentages, the participants who were exposed to yawning yawned 29.4% - 25% = 4.4% more often than those who were not. 36.3.2 Sampling scenario Let’s review the terminology and notation related to sampling we studied in Subsection 33.2.1. In the walkthrough on sampling, our study population was the bowl of \\(N\\) = 2400 balls. Our population parameter of interest was the population proportion of these balls that were red, denoted mathematically by \\(p\\). In order to estimate \\(p\\), we extracted a sample of 50 balls using the shovel and computed the relevant point estimate: the sample proportion that were red, denoted mathematically by \\(\\widehat{p}\\). Who is the study population here? All humans? All the people who watch the show Mythbusters? It’s hard to say! This question can only be answered if we know how the show’s hosts recruited participants! In other words, what was the sampling methodology used by the Mythbusters to recruit participants? Alas, we do not have access to this information. For the purposes of this case study, however, we’ll assume that the 50 participants are a representative sample of all Americans given the popularity of this show. Thus, we’ll be assuming that any results of this experiment will generalize to all \\(N\\) = 346 million Americans (2024 population estimate). Just like with our sampling bowl, the population parameter here will involve proportions. However, in this case, it will be the difference in population proportions \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\), where \\(p_{seed}\\) is the proportion of all Americans who if exposed to yawning will yawn themselves, and \\(p_{control}\\) is the proportion of all Americans who if not exposed to yawning still yawn themselves. Correspondingly, the point estimate/sample statistic based on the Mythbusters’ sample of participants will be the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\). Let’s extend Table 36.1 of scenarios of sampling for inference to include our latest scenario. Table 36.1: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) This is known as a two-sample inference situation since we have two separate samples. Based on their two-samples of size \\(n_{seed}\\) = 34 and \\(n_{control}\\) = 16, the point estimate is \\[ \\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control} = \\frac{24}{34} - \\frac{12}{16} = 0.04411765 \\approx 4.4\\% \\] However, say the Mythbusters repeated this experiment. In other words, say they recruited 50 new participants and exposed 34 of them to yawning and 16 not. Would they find the exact same estimated difference of 4.4%? Probably not, again, because of sampling variation. How does this sampling variation affect their estimate of 4.4%? In other words, what would be a plausible range of values for this difference that accounts for this sampling variation? We can answer this question with confidence intervals! Furthermore, since the Mythbusters only have a single two-sample of 50 participants, they would have to construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) using bootstrap resampling with replacement. Let’s make a couple of important notes. First, for the comparison between the \"seed\" and \"control\" groups to make sense, however, both groups need to be independent from each other. Otherwise, they could influence each other’s results. This means that a participant being selected for the \"seed\" or \"control\" group has no influence on another participant being assigned to one of the two groups. As an example, if there were a mother and her child as participants in the study, they wouldn’t necessarily be in the same group. They would each be assigned randomly to one of the two groups of the explanatory variable. Second, the order of the subtraction in the difference doesn’t matter so long as you are consistent and tailor your interpretations accordingly. In other words, using a point estimate of \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) or \\(\\widehat{p}_{control} - \\widehat{p}_{seed}\\) does not make a material difference, you just need to stay consistent and interpret your results accordingly. 36.3.3 Constructing the confidence interval As we did in Subsection 36.2.3, let’s first construct the bootstrap distribution for \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) and then use this to construct 95% confidence intervals for \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\). We’ll do this using the infer workflow again. However, since the difference in proportions is a new scenario for inference, we’ll need to use some new arguments in the infer functions along the way. 1. specify variables Let’s take our mythbusters_yawn data frame and specify() which variables are of interest using the y ~ x formula interface where: Our response variable is yawn: whether or not a participant yawned. It has levels \"yes\" and \"no\". The explanatory variable is group. It has levels \"seed\" (exposed to yawning) and \"control\" (not exposed to yawning). mythbusters_yawn |&gt; specify(formula = yawn ~ group) Error: A level of the response variable `yawn` needs to be specified for the `success` argument in `specify()`. Alas, we got an error message that infer is telling us that one of the levels of the categorical variable yawn needs to be defined as the success. Recall that we define success to be the event of interest we are trying to count and compute proportions of. Are we interested in those participants who \"yes\" yawned or those who \"no\" didn’t yawn? This isn’t clear to R or someone just picking up the code and results for the first time, so we need to set the success argument to \"yes\" as follows to improve the transparency of the code: mythbusters_yawn |&gt; specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) Response: yawn (factor) Explanatory: group (factor) # A tibble: 50 × 2 yawn group &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 yes seed 2 yes control 3 no seed 4 yes seed 5 no seed 6 no control 7 yes seed 8 no control 9 no control 10 no seed # ℹ 40 more rows 2. generate replicates Our next step is to perform bootstrap resampling with replacement like we did with the almonds in the activity in Section 36.2.1. We saw how it works with both a single variable in computing bootstrap means in Section 36.2.2, but we haven’t yet worked with bootstrapping involving multiple variables. In the infer package, bootstrapping with multiple variables means that each row is potentially resampled. Let’s investigate this by focusing only on the first six rows of mythbusters_yawn: first_six_rows &lt;- head(mythbusters_yawn) first_six_rows # A tibble: 6 × 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1 seed yes 2 2 control yes 3 3 seed no 4 4 seed yes 5 5 seed no 6 6 control no When we bootstrap this data, we are potentially pulling the subject’s readings multiple times. Thus, we could see the entries of \"seed\" for group and \"no\" for yawn together in a new row in a bootstrap sample. This is further seen by exploring the sample_n() function in dplyr on this smaller 6-row data frame comprised of head(mythbusters_yawn). The sample_n() function can perform this bootstrapping procedure and is similar to the rep_sample_n() function in infer, except that it is not repeated, but rather only performs one sample with or without replacement. first_six_rows |&gt; sample_n(size = 6, replace = TRUE) # A tibble: 6 × 3 subj group yawn &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 6 control no 2 1 seed yes 3 2 control yes 4 6 control no 5 4 seed yes 6 4 seed yes We can see that in this bootstrap sample generated from the first six rows of mythbusters_yawn, we have some rows repeated. The same is true when we perform the generate() step in infer as done in what follows. Using this fact, we generate 1000 replicates, or, in other words, we bootstrap resample the 50 participants with replacement 1000 times. mythbusters_yawn |&gt; specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) Response: yawn (factor) Explanatory: group (factor) # A tibble: 50,000 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate yawn group &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 1 yes seed 2 1 yes control 3 1 no control 4 1 no control 5 1 yes seed 6 1 yes seed 7 1 yes seed 8 1 yes seed 9 1 no seed 10 1 yes seed # ℹ 49,990 more rows Observe that the resulting data frame has 50,000 rows. This is because we performed resampling of 50 participants with replacement 1000 times and 50,000 = 1000 \\(\\cdot\\) 50. The variable replicate indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value 1 50 times, the value 2 50 times, all the way through to the value 1000 50 times. 3. calculate summary statistics After we generate() many replicates of bootstrap resampling with replacement, we next want to summarize the bootstrap resamples of size 50 with a single summary statistic, the difference in proportions. We do this by setting the stat argument to \"diff in props\": mythbusters_yawn |&gt; specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;) Warning message: The statistic is based on a difference or ratio; by default, for difference-based statistics, the explanatory variable is subtracted in the order &quot;control&quot; - &quot;seed&quot;, or divided in the order &quot;control&quot; / &quot;seed&quot; for ratio-based statistics. To specify this order yourself, supply `order = c(&quot;control&quot;, &quot;seed&quot;)` to the calculate() function. We see another warning here. We need to specify the order of the subtraction. Is it \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) or \\(\\widehat{p}_{control} - \\widehat{p}_{seed}\\). We specify it to be \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed} - \\widehat{p}_{control}\\) by setting order = c(\"seed\", \"control\"). Note that you could’ve also set order = c(\"control\", \"seed\"). As we stated earlier, the order of the subtraction does not matter, so long as you stay consistent throughout your analysis and tailor your interpretations accordingly. Let’s save the output in a data frame bootstrap_distribution_yawning: bootstrap_distribution_yawning &lt;- mythbusters_yawn |&gt; specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) bootstrap_distribution_yawning # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.0357143 2 2 0.229167 3 3 0.00952381 4 4 0.0106952 5 5 0.00483092 6 6 0.00793651 7 7 -0.0845588 8 8 -0.00466200 9 9 0.164686 10 10 0.124777 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that the resulting data frame has 1000 rows and 2 columns corresponding to the 1000 replicate ID’s and the 1000 differences in proportions for each bootstrap resample in stat. 4. visualize the results In Figure 36.23 we visualize() the resulting bootstrap resampling distribution. Let’s also add a vertical line at 0 by adding a geom_vline() layer. Figure 36.23: Bootstrap distribution. First, let’s compute the 95% confidence interval for \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) using the percentile method, in other words, by identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles which include the middle 95% of values. Recall that this method does not require the bootstrap distribution to be normally shaped. bootstrap_distribution_yawning |&gt; get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;percentile&quot;, level = 0.95) # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.238276 0.302464 Second, since the bootstrap distribution is roughly bell-shaped, we can construct a confidence interval using the standard error method as well. Recall that to construct a confidence interval using the standard error method, we need to specify the center of the interval using the point_estimate argument. In our case, we need to set it to be the difference in sample proportions of 4.4% that the Mythbusters observed. We can also use the infer workflow to compute this value by excluding the generate() 1000 bootstrap replicates step. In other words, do not generate replicates, but rather use only the original sample data. We can achieve this by commenting out the generate() line, telling R to ignore it: obs_diff_in_props &lt;- mythbusters_yawn |&gt; specify(formula = yawn ~ group, success = &quot;yes&quot;) |&gt; # generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;seed&quot;, &quot;control&quot;)) obs_diff_in_props Response: yawn (factor) Explanatory: group (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0441176 We thus plug this value in as the point_estimate argument. myth_ci_se &lt;- bootstrap_distribution_yawning |&gt; get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = obs_diff_in_props, level = 0.95) myth_ci_se # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -0.227291 0.315526 Let’s visualize both confidence intervals in Figure 36.24, with the percentile method interval marked with black lines and the standard-error method marked with grey lines. Observe that they are both similar to each other. Figure 36.24: Two 95% confidence intervals: percentile method (black) and standard error method (grey). 36.3.4 Interpreting the confidence interval Given that both confidence intervals are quite similar, let’s focus our interpretation to only the percentile method confidence interval of (-0.238, 0.302). The precise statistical interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is: if this construction procedure is repeated 100 times, then we expect about 95 of the confidence intervals to capture the true value of \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\). In other words, if we gathered 100 samples of \\(n\\) = 50 participants from a similar pool of people and constructed 100 confidence intervals each based on each of the 100 samples, about 95 of them will contain the true value of \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) while about five won’t. Given that this is a little long winded, we use the shorthand interpretation: we’re 95% “confident” that the true difference in proportions \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) is between (-0.238, 0.302). There is one value of particular interest that this 95% confidence interval contains: zero. If \\(p_{seed} - p_{control}\\) were equal to 0, then there would be no difference in proportion yawning between the two groups. This would suggest that there is no associated effect of being exposed to a yawning recruiter on whether you yawn yourself. In our case, since the 95% confidence interval includes 0, we cannot conclusively say if either proportion is larger. Of our 1000 bootstrap resamples with replacement, sometimes \\(\\widehat{p}_{seed}\\) was higher and thus those exposed to yawning yawned themselves more often. At other times, the reverse happened. Say, on the other hand, the 95% confidence interval was entirely above zero. This would suggest that \\(p_{seed} - p_{control} &gt; 0\\), or, in other words \\(p_{seed} &gt; p_{control}\\), and thus we’d have evidence suggesting those exposed to yawning do yawn more often. 36.4 Summary and final remarks 36.4.1 Additional resources If you want more examples of the infer workflow to construct confidence intervals, we suggest you check out the infer package homepage, in particular, a series of example analyses available at https://infer.netlify.app/articles/. 36.4.2 What’s to come? Now that we’ve equipped ourselves with confidence intervals, we’ll cover the other common tool for statistical inference: hypothesis testing. Just like confidence intervals, hypothesis tests are used to infer about a population using a sample. However, we’ll see that the framework for making such inferences is slightly different.

They acknowledge that there’s always ambiguity in the data but give us some mathematical tools for making the most of the data that we do have. However, it’s very important that we don’t turn “making the most” into absolute confidence. Confidence intervals help us narrow in on an expected statistical range with which to make judgments, but as we discussed last week, they rely on assumptions about what is “normal” that may not hold up. Likewise, hypothesis testing helps us quantify the possibility of being wrong about new assumptions that we want to adopt; however, their very existence also acknowledges the possibility of wrongly adopting those assumptions. Later this week, you’ll read about Type I errors, when we reject a null hypothesis (a term we’ll read more about shortly) even though that hypothesis is actually true. Another name for the Type I error is the false positive. For example, if I take a COVID-19 rapid test, the null hypothesis is that I don’t have COVID-19. While COVID-19 testing is important, generally trustworthy, and really helpful, it isn’t perfect. There’s always the possibility that the test will reject the null hypothesis (that I don’t have COVID-19) and lead me to believe that I’m sick when in reality, I’m actually perfectly healthy. Of course, in the case of COVID-19, what’s more dangerous is a false negative—when a test doesn’t find evidence to reject the null hypothesis but, in fact, the test-taker is actually COVID-positive. False positives can crop up in many applications of data science, and they also serve as a helpful metaphor for other ways that we can read too much into our data. In this chapter, we’ll read about ways that educators can read too much into educational data (including data provided by platforms like Canvas!) and come to wrong conclusions. This is not a literal case of false positives, but the story remains an important reminder that we need to be humble and cautious about trusting data! 38.2 The Dartmouth Cheating Scandal Like many schools, Dartmouth College has increasingly turned to technology to monitor students taking exams at home—this was especially true during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many universities have used proctoring tools that purport to help educators prevent cheating, Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine went dangerously further in 2021. Apparently working under an assumption of guilt, the university launched a dragnet investigation of complicated system logs, searching for data that might reveal student misconduct, without a clear understanding of how those logs can be littered with false positives. Worse still, those attempting to assert their rights have been met with a university administration willing to trust opaque investigations of inconclusive data sets more than their own students. The Boston Globe explained that the medical school administration’s attempts to detect supposed cheating became a flashpoint on campus, exemplifying a worrying trend of schools prioritizing misleading data over the word of their students. The misguided dragnet investigation has cast a shadow over the career aspirations of over twenty medical students. 38.3 What Was Wrong With Dartmouth’s Investigation In March 2021, Dartmouth’s Committee on Student Performance and Conduct (CSPC) accused several students of accessing restricted materials online during exams. These accusations were based on a flawed review of an entire year’s worth of the students’ log data from Canvas, the online learning platform that contains class lectures and information. This broad search was instigated by a single incident of confirmed misconduct, according to a contentious town hall between administrators and students (the Electronic Frontier Foundation—or EFF—re-uploaded this town hall after the original recording was put behind a Dartmouth login screen). These logs show traffic between students’ devices and specific files on Canvas, some of which contain class materials, such as lecture slides. At first glance, the logs showing that a student’s device connected to class files would appear incriminating: timestamps indicate the files were retrieved while students were taking exams. But after reviewing the logs sent to them by a student advocate, it became clear to the EFF that there was no way to determine whether this traffic happened intentionally (as a result of student action) or instead automatically (as background requests from student devices that were logged into Canvas but not in use). In other words, rather than the files being deliberately accessed during exams, the logs could have easily been generated by the automated syncing of course material to devices logged into Canvas but not used during an exam. It was simply impossible to know from the logs alone if a student intentionally accessed any of the files, or if the pings exist due to automatic refresh processes that are commonplace in most websites and online services. Most of us don’t log out of every app, service, or webpage on our smartphones when we’re not using them. Much like a cell phone pinging a tower, the logs showed files being pinged in short time periods and sometimes being accessed at the exact second that students are also entering information into the exam, suggesting a non-deliberate process. The logs also reveal that the files accessed are largely irrelevant to the tests in question, also indicating an automated, random process. A UCLA statistician wrote a letter explaining that even an automated process can result in multiple false-positive outcomes. Canvas’s own documentation explicitly states that the data in these logs “is meant to be used for rollups and analysis in the aggregate, not in isolation for auditing or other high-stakes analysis involving examining single users or small samples.” Given the technical realities of how these background refreshes take place, the log data alone should be nowhere near sufficient to convict a student of academic dishonesty. Along with The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), EFF sent a letter to the Dean of the Medical School on March 30th, explaining how these background connections work and pointing out that the university has likely turned random correlations into accusations of misconduct. The Dean’s reply was that the cases are being reviewed fairly. The EFF disagreed, arguing that the administration was the victim of confirmation bias, turning fallacious evidence of misconduct into accusations of cheating. The school has admitted in some cases that the log data appeared to have been created automatically, acquitting some students who pushed back. However, other students have been sanctioned, apparently entirely based on this spurious interpretation of the log data. Many others are anxiously waiting to hear whether they will be convicted so they can begin the appeal process, potentially with legal counsel. These convictions carry heavy weight, leaving permanent marks on student transcripts that could make it harder for them to enter residencies and complete their medical training. At this level of education, this is not just about being accused of cheating on a specific exam. Being convicted of academic dishonesty could derail an entire career. 38.4 Investigations of Students Must Start With Concrete Evidence Though this investigation wasn’t the result of proctoring software, it was part and parcel of a larger problem: educators have used the pandemic as an excuse to comb for evidence of cheating in places that are far outside their technical expertise. Proctoring tools and investigations like this one flag students based on flawed metrics and misunderstandings of technical processes, rather than concrete evidence of misconduct. Proctoring software that assumes all students take tests the same way—for example, in rooms that they can control, their eyes straight ahead, fingers typing at a routine pace—puts a black mark on the record of students who operate outside the norm. One problem that has been widely documented with proctoring software is that students with disabilities (especially those with motor impairment) are consistently flagged as exhibiting suspicious behavior by software suites intended to detect cheating. Other proctoring software has flagged students for technical snafus such as device crashes and Internet cuts out, as well as completely normal behavior that could indicate misconduct if you squint hard enough. Throughout the pandemic, far too many schools ignored legitimate student concerns about inadequate, or overbroad, anti-cheating software. Across the country, thousands of students, and some parents, have created petitions against the use of proctoring tools, most of which (though not all have been ignored. Students taking the California and New York bar exams—as well as several advocacy organizations and a group of deans—advocated against the use of proctoring tools for those exams. As expected, many of those students then experienced “significant software problems” with the Examsoft proctoring software, specifically, causing some students to fail. Many proctoring companies have defended their dangerous, inequitable, privacy-invasive, and often flawed software tools by pointing out that humans—meaning teachers or administrators—usually have the ability to review flagged exams to determine whether or not a student was actually cheating. That defense rings hollow when those reviewing the results don’t have the technical expertise—or in some cases, the time or inclination—to properly examine them. Similar to schools that rely heavily on flawed proctoring software, Dartmouth medical school has cast suspicion on students by relying on access logs that are far from concrete evidence of cheating. Simply put: these logs should not be used as the sole evidence for potentially ruining a student’s career. After press coverage from the New York Times, which also found that students’ devices could automatically generate Canvas activity data even when no one was using them, Dartmouth’s administration retracted the allegations—but not before students spent months fighting them and fearing what they could mean for their futures. Unfortunately, this has not stopped school officials from considering their interpretation of data to be above reproach. 38.5 A Problem with Companies and Transparency Though Canvas and Blackboard have publicly stated that their logs should not be used for disciplinary decisions regarding high-stakes testing, we’ve heard other stories from students who were accused of misconduct—even well before the pandemic—based on inadequate interpretations of data from these platforms. Since January of 2021, the Canvas instructor guide has explicitly stated: “Quiz logs should not be used to validate academic integrity or identify occurrences of cheating.” In February, an employee of Instructure (the company behind Canvas) commented in a community forum that “weirdness in Canvas Quiz Logs may appear because of various end-user [student] activities or because Canvas prioritizes saving student’s quiz data ahead of logging events. Also, there is a known issue with logging of ‘multiple answer’ questions.”. The employee concluded that “unfortunately, I can’t definitively predict what happened on the users’ end in that particular case.” Despite the admitted and inherently unreliable nature of Canvas logs, and an outcry by accused students and digital rights organizations, schools continue to rely on Canvas logs to determine cheating—and Instructure continues to act as if nothing is wrong. Meanwhile, students’ educational careers are being harmed by these flimsy accusations. In 2020, the administration of James Madison University lowered the grades of students who had been flagged as “inactive” during an exam according to Canvas test-taking logs. Students there spoke out to criticize the validity of the logs. And in the past few months, EFF has heard from other students around the country who have been accused of cheating by their schools, based solely or primarily on Canvas logs. Cheating accusations can result in lowered grades, a black mark on student transcripts, suspension, and even expulsion. Despite the serious consequences students face, they often have very limited recourse. Disturbingly, Canvas provides logs to administrators and teachers, but accused students have been unable to see those same logs, either via the platform itself or from school officials. Students deserve better. Instructure (and other companies) must do better. Admitting to the unreliability of Canvas logs in obscure webpages is not enough. Instructure ought to to issue a clear, public announcement that Canvas logs are unreliable and should not be used to fuel cheating accusations. The company should also allow students to access the same logs their schools are increasingly using to accuse them of academic misconduct—which is important because, when viewed in their entirety, Canvas logs often don’t rationally reveal activity consistent with cheating Instructure has a responsibility to prevent schools from misusing their products. Taking action now would show the company’s commitment to the integrity of the academic process, and would give students a chance to face their accusers on the same footing, rather than resigning to an unjust and opaque process. 38.6 Not Just Dartmouth In 2018, an undergraduate student at Brown University was penalized based on Canvas access logs and subsequently contacted the EFF. The student had attempted to access the Canvas database immediately before an exam, and had then left multiple browser windows open to the Canvas web address on her mobile phone. The phone remained unused in her backpack during the exam, during which time the log records (inaccurately) appeared to indicate that the site was being actively accessed by a user. After being accused of cheating based on this Canvas log data, the student reached out to Canvas. Multiple Canvas technical support representatives responded by explaining that the log data was not a reliable record of user access. The student shared their statements with Brown. Notably, the student, who had a 4.0 record, had little motive to cheat on the exam at issue, rendering the cheating accusation—based as it was virtually entirely on the log data—all the more flimsy. A Brown disciplinary panel nonetheless ruled against the student, and placed a permanent mark on her academic record, grounding its decision on the accuracy of the Canvas log data. Last year, in the wake of Dartmouth’s apology to its wrongfully accused students, and Canvas’ more public acknowledgment that its logs should not be used as the basis for disciplinary decisions, the former student asked Brown to clear her academic record. Brown, however, refused even to consider voiding its disciplinary decision on the ground that the student had no remaining right to appeal. This is a common thread we’ve seen in these situations: the students at Dartmouth were also not afforded reasonable due process—they were not provided complete data logs for the exams, were given less than 48 hours to respond to the charges (and only two minutes to make their cases in online hearings), and were purportedly told to admit guilt. In an implicit acknowledgment of its error, Brown now says that it will provide its former student with a letter of support if she applies to graduate school. An implicit admission of injustice, however, is not a sufficient remedy. Like Dartmouth, Brown should withdraw the record of the discipline it wrongfully imposed on this student, as well as any others who may have likewise been found responsible for cheating based on such unreliable log records. Schools should accept that Canvas logs cannot replace concrete, dispositive evidence of cheating. In fact, the EFF has written a guide for educating administrators and teachers on these logs’ inaccuracy. 38.7 Conclusion The “false positives” in these stories are not Type I errors as we’ll be discussing in the context of hypothesis testing. Nonetheless, they serve as powerful reminders that data cannot always be trusted. These universities didn’t necessarily act maliciously—indeed, it’s understandable that institutions of higher education would want to crack down on cheating! Instead, the main error that these schools made was assuming that data are always objective and trustworthy instead of being open to the ways in which seemingly straightforward data can fail us. As data scientists, it’s important that we avoid the same mistake.

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. Last module, we studied confidence intervals; this module, we’ll cover hypothesis testing, another widely used method for statistical inference. In hypothesis testing, a claim is made about a value or characteristic of the population and then a random sample is used to infer the plausibility of this claim or hypothesis. For example, we’ll use data collected from Spotify to investigate whether metal music is more popular than deep-house music. We have already discussed many of the necessary concepts to understand hypothesis testing in our walkthroughs on sampling and confidence intervals. We can now go deeper into these ideas and establish a general framework for understanding hypothesis tests. By understanding this general framework, you will be able to adapt it to many different scenarios. In Section 39.1 we’ll review confidence intervals and introduce hypothesis tests for one-sample problems; in particular, for the mean \\(\\mu\\). We’ll use both theory-based and simulation-based approaches, and I’ll provide some justification why it may be a better idea to carefully unpack the simulation-based approach for hypothesis testing in the context of two-sample problems. I’ll also show the direct link between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. In Section 39.2 we’ll begin an activity that motivates the simulation-based approach for two-sample problems; we’ll use data collected from Spotify to investigate whether metal music is more popular than deep-house music. In Sections 39.3, 39.4, and 39.5 we’ll review, conduct, and interpret hypothesis tests using the simulation-based approach of permutation. We’ll then consider a case study in Section 39.6, and in Section 39.7 we conclude with a discussion of the theory-based approach for two-sample problems and some additional remarks. Needed packages If needed, read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(infer) library(nycflights23) library(ggplot2movies) Recall that loading the tidyverse package loads many packages that we have encountered earlier. For details refer to Section 18.4. The packages moderndive and infer contain functions and data frames that will be used in this chapter. 39.1 Tying confidence intervals to hypothesis testing In Chapter 36, we used a random sample to construct an interval estimate of the population mean. When using the theory-based approach, we relied on the Central Limit Theorem to form these intervals; when using the simulation-based approach we do it, for example, using the bootstrap percentile method. Hypothesis testing takes advantages of similar tools but the nature and the goal of the problem are different. Still, there is a direct link between confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. In this section, let’s first look at a one-sample hypothesis test for the population mean. We’ll then establish the connection between confidence intervals and hypothesis test. This connection is direct when using the theory-based approach but requires careful consideration when using the simulation-based approach. We’ll proceed by describing hypothesis testing in the case of two-sample problems. 39.1.1 The one-sample hypothesis test for the population mean Let’s continue working with the population mean, \\(\\mu\\). When discussing confidence intervals, we used a random sample to construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\). When performing hypothesis testing, we test a claim about \\(\\mu\\) by collecting a random sample and using it to determine if the sample obtained is consistent with the claim made. To illustrate this idea, let’s return to the chocolate-covered almonds activity. Assume that the almonds’ company has stated on its website that the average weight of a chocolate-covered almond is exactly 3.6 grams. Imagine that we aren’t so sure about this claim and believe that the a chocolate-covered almond’s weight is different than 3.6 grams on average. To test these competing claims, we’ll again use the random sample almonds_sample_100 from the moderndive package. Here are the first 10 lines: almonds_sample_100 # A tibble: 100 × 2 ID weight &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 166 4.2 2 1215 4.2 3 1899 3.9 4 1912 3.8 5 4637 3.3 6 511 3.5 7 127 4 8 4419 3.5 9 4729 4.2 10 2574 4.1 # ℹ 90 more rows The goal of hypothesis testing is to answer the question: “Assuming that this claim is true, how likely is it to observe a sample as extreme as or more extreme than the one we have observed?” When the answer to the question is: “If the claim was true, it would be very unlikely to observe a sample such as the one we have obtained” we would conclude that the claim cannot be true and we would reject it. Otherwise, we would fail to reject the claim. (Note that we do not accept the claim!) The claim is a statement called the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\). It is a statement about \\(\\mu\\), and it is initially assumed to be true. A competing statement called the alternative hypothesis, \\(H_A\\), is also a statement about \\(\\mu\\) and contains all the possible values not included under the null hypothesis. In the almonds’ activity the hypotheses are: \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;H_0: &amp;\\mu = 3.6\\\\ &amp;H_A: &amp;\\mu \\ne 3.6 \\end{aligned}\\] Evidence against the null may appear if the estimate of \\(\\mu\\) in the random sample collected, the sample mean, is much greater or much less than the value of \\(\\mu\\) under the null hypothesis. How do we determine which claim should be the null hypothesis and which one the alternative hypothesis? Always remember that the null hypothesis has a privileged status since we assume it to be true until we find evidence against it. We only rule in favor of the alternative hypothesis if we find evidence in the data to reject the null hypothesis. In this context, a researcher who wants to show some results or conclusions for new findings, needs to prove that the null hypothesis is not true by finding evidence against it. We often say that the researcher bears the burden of proof. The hypothesis shown above represents a two-sided test because evidence against the null hypothesis could come from either direction (greater or less). Sometimes it is convenient to work with a left-sided test. In our example, the claim under the null hypothesis becomes: “the average weight is at least 3.6 grams” and the researcher’s goal is to find evidence against this claim in favor of the competing claim “the weight is less than 3.6 grams.” The competing hypotheses can now be written as \\(H_0: \\mu \\ge 3.6\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu &lt; 3.6\\) or even as \\(H_0: \\mu = 3.6\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu &lt; 3.6\\). Notice that we can drop the inequality part from the null hypothesis. This simplification becomes convenient as we focus on the equal part of the null hypothesis only and becomes clearer that evidence against the null hypothesis may come only with values to the left of 3.6, hence a left-sided test. Similarly, a right-sided test can be stated \\(H_0: \\mu = 3.6\\) versus \\(H_A: \\mu &gt; 3.6\\). Claims under the null hypothesis for this type of test could be stated as “the average weight is at most 3.6 grams” or even “the average weight is less than 3.6 grams.” But observe that less does not contain the equal part, so how can the null then be \\(H_0: \\mu = 3.6\\)? The reason is related to the method used more than the semantics of the statement. Let’s break this down: If, under the null hypothesis, the average weight is less than 3.6 grams, we can only find evidence against the null if we find sample means that are much greater than 3.6 grams, hence the alternative hypothesis is \\(H_A: \\mu &gt; 3.6\\). Now, to find the evidence we are looking for, the methods we use require a point of reference, “less than 3.6” is not a fixed number since 2 is less than 3.6 but so too is 3.59. On the other hand, if we can find evidence that the average is greater than 3.6, then it is also true that the average is greater than 3.5, 2, or any other number less than 3.6. Thus, as a convention, we include the equal sign always in the statement under the null hypothesis. Let’s return to the test. We’ll work with the two-sided test in what follows, but I’ll note the changes needed in the process if we were instead working with the left- or right-sided alternatives. The theory-based approach We use the theory-based approach to illustrate how a hypothesis test is conducted. We first calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation from this sample: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight), sample_sd = sd(weight)) # A tibble: 1 × 2 sample_mean sample_sd &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.682 0.362199 Recall that due to the Central Limit Theorem, the sample mean weight of almonds, \\(\\overline X\\), is approximately normally distributed with expected value equal to \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation equal to \\(\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). Since the population standard deviation is unknown, we use the sample standard deviation, \\(s\\), to calculate the standard error \\(s/\\sqrt{n}\\). As presented in Subsection 36.1.4, the \\(t\\)-test statistic \\[t = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\\] follows a \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Of course, we do not know what \\(\\mu\\) is. But since we assume that the null hypothesis is true, we can use this value to obtain the test statistic as shown in this code next. Table 39.1 presents these values. almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(x_bar = mean(weight), s = sd(weight), n = length(weight), t = (x_bar - 3.6)/(s/sqrt(n))) Table 39.1: Sample mean, standard deviation, size, and the t-test statistic x_bar s n t 3.68 0.362 100 2.26 The value of \\(t = 2.26\\) is the sample mean standardized such that the claim \\(\\mu = 3.6\\) grams corresponds to the center of the \\(t\\) distribution (\\(t = 0\\)), and the sample mean observed, \\(\\overline x = 0.36\\), corresponds to the \\(t\\) test statistic (t = 2.26). Assuming that the null hypothesis is true (\\(\\mu = 3.6\\) grams), how likely is it to observe a sample as extreme as or more extreme than almonds_sample_100? Or correspondingly, how likely is it to observe a sample mean as extreme as or more extreme than \\(\\overline x = 0.36\\)? Or even, how likely is it to observe a test statistic that is \\(t = 2.26\\) units or more away from the center of the \\(t\\) distribution? Because this is a two-sided test, we care about extreme values that are 2.26 away in either direction of the distribution. The shaded regions on both tails of the \\(t\\) distribution in Figure 39.1 represent the probability of these extreme values. Figure 39.1: The tails of a t curve for this hypothesis test. The function pt() finds the area under a \\(t\\) curve to the left of a given value. The function requires the argument q (quantile) that in our example is the value of \\(t\\) on the left part of the plot (-2.26) and the argument df, the degrees of freedom that for a one-sample test are \\(n-1\\). The sample size of almonds_sample_100 was \\(n = 100\\). Finally, since we need the area on both tails and the \\(t\\) distribution is symmetric, we simply multiply the results by 2: 2 * pt(q = -2.26, df = 100 - 1) We have determined that, assuming that the null hypothesis is true, the probability of getting a sample as extreme as or more extreme than almonds_sample_100 is 0.026. This probability is called the \\(p\\)-value. What does this mean? Well, most statistics textbooks will state that, given a significance level, often set as \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), if the \\(p\\)-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\), we reject the null hypothesis. While technically not incorrect, this type of statement does not provide enough insight for students to fully understand the conclusion. Let’s unpack some of these elements and provide additional context to them: The key element of the conclusion is to determine whether the statement under the null hypothesis can be rejected. If assuming that the null hypothesis is true, it is very unlikely (almost impossible) to observe a random sample such as the one we have observed, we need to reject the null hypothesis, but we would not reject the null hypothesis in any other situation. In that sense, the null hypothesis has a privileged status. The reason for this is that we do not want to make a mistake and reject the null hypothesis when the claim under it is actually true. In statistics, making this mistake is called a Type I Error. So, we only reject the null hypothesis if the chances of committing a Type I Error are truly small. The significance level, denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\alpha\\) (pronounced “alpha”), is precisely the probability of committing a Type I Error. What are the chances you are willing to take? Again, \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is what most textbooks use and many research communities have adopted for decades. While we should be able to work with this number (after all, we may need to interact with people that are used to this standard approach), we want here to treat it as one of many possible numbers. The significance level, \\(\\alpha\\), is a predefined level of accepted uncertainty. This value should be defined well before the \\(p\\)-value has been calculated, or even before data has been collected. Ideally, it should represent our tolerance for uncertainty. But, how can we determine what this value should be? Let’s consider an example. Assume that you are a student and have to take a test in your data science class worth 100 points. You have studied for the test, and you expect to get a passing grade (score in the 80s) but not better than that. The day of the exam the instructor gives you one additional option. You can take the exam and receive a grade based on your performance or you can play the following game: the instructor rolls a fair six-sided die. If the top face shows a “one” you score zero on your test, otherwise you score 100. There is a 1 in 6 chance that you get zero. Would you play this game? If you would not play the game, let’s change it. Now the instructor rolls the die twice, you score 0 in the test only if both rolls are “one.” Otherwise, you score 100. There is only a 1 in 36 chance to get zero. Would you now play this game? What if the instructor rolls the die five times and you score zero in the test only if each roll is a “one”—otherwise, you score 100. There is only a 1 in 7776 chance to get a zero. Would you play this game? Converted to probabilities, the three games shown above give you the probabilities of getting a zero equal to \\(1/6 = 0.167\\), \\(1/36 = 0.028\\), and \\(1/7776 = 0.0001\\), respectively. Think of these as \\(p\\)-values and getting a zero in the test as committing a Type I Error. In the context of a hypothesis test, when 1) the random sample collected is extreme, 2) the \\(p\\)-value is really small, and 3) we reject the null hypothesis, there is still always a chance that the null hypothesis was true, the random sample collected was very atypical, and these results led us to commit a Type I Error. There is always uncertainty when using random samples to make inferences about populations. All we can do is decide our level of tolerance for this uncertainty. Is it \\(1/6 = 0.167\\), \\(1/36 = 0.028\\), \\(1/7776 = 0.0001\\), or some other level? This is precisely the significance level \\(\\alpha\\). Returning to the almond example, if we had set \\(\\alpha = 0.04\\) and we observed the \\(p\\)-value = 0.026, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is not equal to 3.6 grams. When the null hypothesis is rejected we say that the result of the test is statistically significant. Let’s summarize the steps for hypothesis testing (in the context of \\(\\mu\\)): Based on the claim we are planning to test, we state the null and alternative hypothesis in terms of \\(\\mu\\). The equal sign should go under the null hypothesis as this is needed for the method. The statement under the null hypothesis is assumed to be true during the process. Typically, researchers want to conclude in favor of the alternative hypothesis; that is, they try to see if the data provides evidence against the null hypothesis. We set a significance level \\(\\alpha\\), based on our tolerance for committing a Type I Error, always before working with the sample. We obtain the sample mean, sample standard deviation, \\(t\\)-test statistic, and \\(p\\)-value. When working with a two-sided test, as in the almond example above, the \\(p\\)-value is the area on both tails. For a left-sided test, find the area under the \\(t\\) distribution to the left of the observed \\(t\\) test statistic. For a right-sided test, find the area under the \\(t\\) distribution to the right of the observed \\(t\\) test statistic. We determine whether the result of the test is statistically significant (if the null is rejected) or non-significant (the null is not rejected). The simulation-based approach When using a simulation-based approach such as the bootstrap percentile method, we repeat the first two steps of the theory-based approach: State the null and alternative hypothesis in terms of \\(\\mu\\). The statement under the null hypothesis is assumed to be true during the process. Set a significance level, \\(\\alpha\\), based on your tolerance for committing a Type I Error. In Step 1, we need to assume the null hypothesis is true. This presents a technical complication in the bootstrap percentile method since the sample collected and corresponding bootstrap samples are based on the real distribution and if the null hypothesis is not true they cannot reflect this. The solution is to shift the sample values by a constant so as to make the sample mean equal to the claimed population mean under the null hypothesis. The infer workflow takes this into account automatically, but when introduced to students for the first time, the additional shifting tends to create some confusion in the intuition of the method. It can be easier to introduce the elements of the simulation-based approach to hypothesis testing via the two-sample problem context using another resampling technique called permutation. We’ll do this later, looking at the details of this method in Sections 39.3, 39.4, and 39.5. Once we are very comfortable using this method, we can then explore the bootstrap percentile method for one-sample problems. For completeness, here are the code and results of the one-sample hypothesis test for the almonds’ problem. null_dist &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;point&quot;, mu = 3.6) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) x_bar_almonds &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(sample_mean = mean(weight)) |&gt; select(sample_mean) null_dist |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = x_bar_almonds, direction = &quot;two-sided&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.032 The \\(p\\)-value is 0.032. This is fairly similar to the \\(p\\)-value obtained using the theory-based approach. Using the same significance level \\(\\alpha = 0.04\\) we again reject the null hypothesis. 39.1.2 Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals Even though hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are two different approaches that have different goals, they complement each other. For example, in Subsection 36.1.4 we calculated the 95% confidence interval for the almonds’ mean weight, \\(\\mu\\), using the sample almonds_sample_100. The theory-based approach was given by \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\left(\\overline{x} - 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}},\\quad \\overline{x} + 1.98 \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) \\end{aligned} \\] and the 95% confidence interval is: almonds_sample_100 |&gt; summarize(lower_bound = mean(weight) - 1.98*sd(weight)/sqrt(length(weight)), upper_bound = mean(weight) + 1.98*sd(weight)/sqrt(length(weight))) # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_bound upper_bound &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61028 3.75372 Using the simulation-based approach via the bootstrap percentile method, the 95% confidence interval is bootstrap_means &lt;- almonds_sample_100 |&gt; specify(response = weight) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;mean&quot;) bootstrap_means |&gt; get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 3.61198 3.756 Both 95% confidence intervals are very similar and, more importantly, neither interval contains \\(\\mu = 3.6\\) grams. Recall that when performing hypothesis testing we rejected the null hypothesis, \\(H_0: \\mu = 3.6\\). The results obtained using confidence intervals are consistent with the conclusions of hypothesis testing. In general, if the values for \\(\\mu\\) under the null hypothesis are not part of the confidence interval, the null hypothesis is rejected. Note, however, that the confidence level used when constructing the interval, 95% in our example, needs to be consistent with the significance level, \\(\\alpha\\), used for the hypothesis test. In particular, when the hypothesis test is two-sided and a significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is used, we calculate a confidence interval for a confidence level equal to \\((1 - \\alpha)\\times 100\\%\\). For example, if \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) then the corresponding confidence level is \\((1 - 0.05) = 0.95\\) or \\(95\\%\\). The correspondence is direct because the confidence intervals that we calculate are always two-sided. On the other hand, if the hypothesis test used is one-sided (left or right), calculate a confidence interval with a confidence level equal to \\((1 - 2\\alpha)\\times 100\\%\\). For example, if \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) then, the corresponding confidence level needed is \\((1 - 2\\cdot 0.05) = 0.9\\) or \\(90\\%\\). This section concludes our discussion about one-sample hypothesis tests. Observe that, as we have done for confidence intervals, we can also construct hypothesis tests for proportions, and when using the bootstrap percentile method, we can do it also for other quantities, such as the population median, quartiles, etc. Let’s now focus on building hypothesis tests for two-sample problems. 39.2 Music popularity activity Let’s start with an activity studying the effect of music genre on Spotify song popularity. 39.2.1 Is metal music more popular than deep house music? Imagine that you are a music analyst for Spotify and that you are curious about whether fans of metal or deep house are more passionate about their favorite genres. You want to determine if there’s a significant difference in the popularity of these two genres. In this case, we’ll measure popularity with data available through Spotify—say, the average number of streams and recent user interactions on tracks classified under each genre. (Note that Spotify does not actually disclose how this metric is calculated, so we’re making some assumptions here…) This question sets the stage for our exploration into hypothesis testing. Metal music, characterized by its aggressive sounds, powerful vocals, and complex instrumentals, has cultivated a loyal fanbase that often prides itself on its deep appreciation for the genre’s intensity and technical skill. On the other hand, deep house music, with its smooth, soulful rhythms and steady beats, attracts listeners who enjoy the genre’s calming and immersive vibe, often associated with late-night clubs and chill-out sessions. By comparing the popularity metrics between these two genres, we can determine if one truly resonates more with listeners on Spotify. This exploration not only deepens our understanding of musical preferences but also serves as a practical introduction to the principles of hypothesis testing. To begin the analysis, we’ll consider 2000 selected at random from Spotify’s song archive. (I will use “song” and “track” interchangeably going forward.) In our sample, there are 1000 metal tracks and 1000 deep house tracks. The moderndive package contains the data on the songs by genre in the spotify_by_genre data frame. There are six genres selected in that data: country, deep-house, dubstep, hip-hop, metal, and rock.Let’s explore this data by focusing on just metal and deep-house by looking at 12 randomly selected rows and our columns of interest in Table 39.2. Note that we’ll also group our selection so that each of the four possible groupings of track_genre and popular_or_not are selected. Note also that because of random selection, you may get different results than what I display here: spotify_metal_deephouse &lt;- spotify_by_genre |&gt; filter(track_genre %in% c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) |&gt; select(track_genre, artists, track_name, popularity, popular_or_not) spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; group_by(track_genre, popular_or_not) |&gt; sample_n(size = 3) Table 39.2: Sample of twelve songs from the Spotify data frame. track_genre artists track_name popularity popular_or_not deep-house LYOD;Tom Auton On My Way 51 popular deep-house Sunmoon Just the Two of Us 52 popular deep-house Tensnake;Nazzereene Latching Onto You 51 popular metal Slipknot Psychosocial 66 popular deep-house BCX Miracle In The Middle Of My Heart - Original Mix 41 not popular metal blessthefall I Wouldn’t Quit If Everyone Quit 0 not popular deep-house Junge Junge;Tyron Hapi I’m The One - Tyron Hapi Remix 49 not popular metal Poison Every Rose Has Its Thorn - Remastered 2003 0 not popular metal Armored Dawn S.O.S. 54 popular deep-house James Hype;Pia Mia;PS1 Good Luck (feat. Pia Mia) - PS1 Remix 47 not popular metal Hollywood Undead Riot 26 not popular metal Breaking Benjamin Ashes of Eden 61 popular The track_genre variable indicates what genre the song is classified under, the artists and track_name columns provide additional information about the track by providing the artist and the name of the song, popularity is the metric mentioned earlier given by Spotify, and popular_or_not is a categorical representation of the popularity column with any value of 50 (the 75th percentile of popularity) referring to popular and anything at or below 50 as not_popular. This decision (to use 50 as our cutoff) is a bit arbitrary and could be changed to any other value. Let’s perform an exploratory data analysis of the relationship between the two categorical variables track_genre and popular_or_not. Remember from earlier in the semester that one way we can visualize such a relationship is by using a stacked barplot. ggplot(spotify_metal_deephouse, aes(x = track_genre, fill = popular_or_not)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = &quot;Genre of track&quot;) Figure 39.2: Barplot relating genre to popularity. Notice in Figure 39.2 that, in this sample, metal songs are only slightly more popular than deep house songs. We can telll this by looking at the height of the popular bars. Let’s quantify these popularity rates by computing the proportion of songs classified as popular for each of the two genres using the dplyr package for data wrangling. Note the use of the tally() function here which is a shortcut for summarize(n = n()) to get counts. spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; group_by(track_genre, popular_or_not) |&gt; tally() # Same as summarize(n = n()) # A tibble: 4 × 3 # Groups: track_genre [2] track_genre popular_or_not n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 deep-house not popular 471 2 deep-house popular 529 3 metal not popular 437 4 metal popular 563 So of the 1000 metal songs, 563 were popular, for a proportion of 563/1000 = 0.563 = 56.3%. On the other hand, of the 1000 deep house songs, 529 were popular, for a proportion of 529/1000 = 0.529 = 52.9%. Comparing these two rates of popularity, it appears that metal songs were popular at a rate 0.563 \\(-\\) 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4% higher than deep house songs. This suggests an advantage for metal songs in terms of popularity. However, the question is whether this provides conclusive evidence that there is greater popularity for metal songs compared to deep house songs. Could a difference in popularity rates of 3.4% still occur by chance, even in a hypothetical world where no difference in popularity existed between the two genres? In other words, what is the role of sampling variation in this hypothesized world? To answer this question, we will again rely on a computer to run simulations. 39.2.2 Shuffling once First, try to imagine a hypothetical universe where there was no difference in the popularity of metal and deep house. In such a hypothetical universe, the genre of a song would have no bearing on their chances of popularity. Bringing things back to our spotify_metal_deephouse data frame, the popular_or_not variable would thus be an irrelevant label. If these popular_or_not labels were irrelevant, then we could randomly reassign them by “shuffling” them to no consequence! To illustrate this idea, let’s narrow our focus to 52 chosen songs of the 2000 that you saw earlier. The track_genre column shows what the original genre of the song was. Note that to keep this smaller dataset of 52 rows to be a representative sample of the 2000 rows, the original authors sampled such that the popularity rate for each of metal and deep-house is close to the original rates of 0.563 and 0.529, respectively, prior to shuffling. This data is available in the spotify_52_original data frame in the moderndive package. We also remove the track_id column for simplicity. It is an identification variable that is not relevant for our analysis. A sample of this is shown in Table 39.3. spotify_52_original |&gt; select(-track_id) |&gt; head(10) Table 39.3: Representative sample of metal and deep-house songs track_genre artists track_name popularity popular_or_not deep-house Jess Bays;Poppy Baskcomb Temptation (feat.

The popular_or_not column in the spotify_52_shuffled data frame in the moderndive package shows one such possible random shuffling. spotify_52_shuffled |&gt; select(-track_id) |&gt; head(10) Table 39.4: Shuffled version of popular_or_not in sample track_genre artists track_name popularity popular_or_not deep-house Jess Bays;Poppy Baskcomb Temptation (feat.

Some of the original popular now are not popular, some of the not popular are popular, and others are the same as the original. Again, such random shuffling of the popular_or_not label only makes sense in our hypothesized universe of no difference in popularity between genres. Is there a tactile way for us to understand what is going on with this shuffling? One way would be by using a standard deck of 52 playing cards, which we display in Figure 39.3. Figure 39.3: Standard deck of 52 playing cards. Since we started with equal sample sizes of 1000 songs for each genre, we can think about splitting the deck in half to have 26 cards in two piles (one for metal and another for deep-house). After shuffling these 52 cards as seen in Figure 39.4, we split the deck equally into the two piles of 26 cards each. Then, we can flip the cards over one-by-one, assigning “popular” for each red card and “not popular” for each black card keeping a tally of how many of each genre are popular. Figure 39.4: Shuffling a deck of cards. Let’s repeat the same exploratory data analysis we did for the original spotify_metal_deephouse data on our spotify_52_original and spotify_52_shuffled data frames. Let’s create a barplot visualizing the relationship between track_genre and the new shuffled popular_or_not variable and then compare this to the original un-shuffled version in Figure 39.5. ggplot(spotify_52_shuffled, aes(x = track_genre, fill = popular_or_not)) + geom_bar() + labs(x = &quot;Genre of track&quot;) Figure 39.5: Barplots of relationship of genre with popular or not' (left) and shuffledpopular or not’ (right). The difference in metal versus deep house popularity rates is now different. Compared to the original data in the left barplot, the new “shuffled” data in the right barplot has popularity rates that are actually in the opposite direction as they were originally. This is because the shuffling process has removed any relationship between genre and popularity. Let’s also compute the proportion of tracks that are now “popular” in the popular_or_not column for each genre: spotify_52_shuffled |&gt; group_by(track_genre, popular_or_not) |&gt; tally() # A tibble: 4 × 3 # Groups: track_genre [2] track_genre popular_or_not n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 deep-house not popular 10 2 deep-house popular 16 3 metal not popular 13 4 metal popular 13 So, in this one sample of a hypothetical universe of no difference in genre popularity, \\(13/26 = 0.5 = 50\\%\\) of metal songs were popular. On the other hand, \\(16/26 = 0.615 = 61.5\\%\\) of deep house songs were popular. Let’s next compare these two values. It appears that metal tracks were popular at a rate that was \\(0.5 - 0.615 = -0.115 = -11.5\\) percentage points different than deep house songs. Observe how this difference in rates is not the same as the difference in rates of 0.034 = 3.4% we originally observed. This is once again due to sampling variation. How can we better understand the effect of this sampling variation? By repeating this shuffling several times! 39.2.3 What did we just do? What we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical procedure known as hypothesis testing using a permutation test. The term “permutation” is the mathematical term for “shuffling”: taking a series of values and reordering them randomly, as you did with the playing cards. In fact, permutations are another form of resampling, like the bootstrap method you performed in Chapter 36. While the bootstrap method involves resampling with replacement, permutation methods involve resampling without replacement. We do not need restrict our analysis to a dataset of 52 rows only. It is useful as an example to manually shuffle the deck of cards and assign values of popular or not popular to different songs, but the same ideas can be applied to each of the 2000 tracks in our spotify_metal_deephouse data. With this data, we can think about an inference about an unknown difference in population proportions with the 2000 tracks being our sample. We denote this as \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\), where \\(p_{m}\\) is the population proportion of songs with metal names being popular and \\(p_{d}\\) is the equivalent for deep house songs. Recall that this is one of the scenarios for inference we have seen so far in Table 39.5. Table 39.5: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) So, based on our sample of \\(n_m = 1000\\) metal tracks and \\(n_f = 1000\\) deep house tracks, the point estimate for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) is the difference in sample proportions \\[\\widehat{p}_{m} -\\widehat{p}_{f} = 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034.\\] This difference in favor of metal songs of 0.034 (3.4 percentage points) is greater than 0, suggesting metal songs are more popular than deep house songs. However, the question we asked ourselves was “is this difference meaningfully greater than 0?”. In other words, is that difference indicative of true popularity, or can we just attribute it to sampling variation? Hypothesis testing allows us to make such distinctions. 39.3 Understanding hypothesis tests Much like the terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling we covered previously, there are a lot of terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis testing. Some of this was introduced in Section 39.1. Learning these may seem like a very daunting task at first. However, with practice, practice, and more practice, anyone can master them. First, a hypothesis is a statement about the value of an unknown population parameter. In our genre popularity activity, our population parameter of interest is the difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\). Hypothesis tests can involve any of the population parameters in Table 36.1 of the five inference scenarios we will cover in this book and also more advanced types we will not cover here. Second, a hypothesis test consists of a test between two competing hypotheses: (1) a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) (pronounced “H-naught”) versus (2) an alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) (also denoted \\(H_1\\)). When working with the comparison of two populations parameters, typically, the null hypothesis is a claim that there is “no effect” or “no difference of interest.” In many cases, the null hypothesis represents the status quo. Furthermore, the alternative hypothesis is the claim the experimenter or researcher wants to establish or find evidence to support. It is viewed as a “challenger” hypothesis to the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). In our genre popularity activity, an appropriate hypothesis test would be: \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: \\text{metal and deep house have the same popularity rate}\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A &amp;: \\text{metal is popular at a higher rate than deep house} \\end{aligned} \\] Note some of the choices we have made. First, we set the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) to be that there is no difference in popularity rate, and we set the “challenger” alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) to be that there is a difference in favor of metal. As discussed earlier, the null hypothesis is set to reflect a situation of “no change.” As we discussed earlier, in this case, \\(H_0\\) corresponds to there being no difference in popularity. Furthermore, we set \\(H_A\\) to be that metal is popular at a higher rate, a subjective choice reflecting a prior suspicion we have that this is the case. As discussed earlier this is a one-sided test. It can be left- or right-sided, and this becomes clear once we express it in terms of proportions. If someone else, however, does not share such suspicions and only wants to investigate that there is a difference, whether higher or lower, they would construct a two-sided test. We can re-express the formulation of our hypothesis test using the mathematical notation for our population parameter of interest, the difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\): \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A&amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0 \\end{aligned} \\] Observe how the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) is written \\(p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\). Since we have chosen this particular formulation, the one-sided test becomes right-sided because we are looking for a difference that is greater than zero as evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Had we opted for a two-sided alternative, we would have set \\(p_{m} - p_{d} \\neq 0\\). We work here with the right-sided test and will present an example of a two-sided test in Section 39.6. Third, a test statistic is a point estimate/sample statistic formula used for hypothesis testing. Note that a sample statistic is merely a summary statistic based on a sample of observations. Recall we saw in Section 24.2 that a summary statistic takes in many values and returns only one. Here, the samples would be the \\(n_m = 1000\\) metal songs and the \\(n_f = 1000\\) deep house songs. Hence, the point estimate of interest is the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\). Fourth, the observed test statistic is the value of the test statistic that we observed in real life. In our case, we computed this value using the data saved in the spotify_metal_deephouse data frame. It was the observed difference of \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} -\\widehat{p}_{d} = 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4\\%\\) in favor of metal songs. Fifth, the null distribution is the sampling distribution of the test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Let’s unpack these ideas slowly. The key to understanding the null distribution is that the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is assumed to be true. We are not saying that \\(H_0\\) is true at this point, we are only assuming it to be true for hypothesis-testing purposes. In our case, this corresponds to our hypothesized universe of no difference in popularity rates. Assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), also stated as “Under \\(H_0\\),” how does the test statistic vary due to sampling variation? In our case, how will the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{f}\\) vary due to sampling under \\(H_0\\)? Recall from Subsection 33.3.4 that distributions displaying how point estimates vary due to sampling variation are called sampling distributions. The only additional thing to keep in mind about null distributions is that they are sampling distributions assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Sixth, the \\(p\\)-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as extreme as or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. You can think of the \\(p\\)-value as a quantification of “surprise”: assuming \\(H_0\\) is true, how surprised are we with what we observed? Or in our case, in our hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity, how surprised are we that we observed higher popularity rates of 0.034 from our collected samples if no difference in genre popularity exists? Very surprised? Somewhat surprised? The \\(p\\)-value quantifies this probability, or what proportion had a more “extreme” result? Here, extreme is defined in terms of the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) that metal popularity is at a higher rate than deep house. In other words, how often was the popularity of metal even more pronounced than \\(0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4\\%\\)? Seventh and lastly, in many hypothesis testing procedures, it is commonly recommended to set the significance level of the test beforehand. It is denoted by \\(\\alpha\\). Please review our discussion of \\(\\alpha\\) in Section 39.1.1 when we discussed the theory-based approach. For now, it is sufficient to recall that if the \\(p\\)-value is less than or equal to \\(\\alpha\\), we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). Alternatively, if the \\(p\\)-value is greater than \\(\\alpha\\), we would “fail to reject \\(H_0\\).” Note the latter statement is not quite the same as saying we “accept \\(H_0\\).” This distinction is rather subtle and not immediately obvious. So, we will revisit it later in Section 39.5. While different fields tend to use different values of \\(\\alpha\\), some commonly used values for \\(\\alpha\\) are 0.1, 0.01, and 0.05; with 0.05 being the choice people often make without putting much thought into it. We will talk more about \\(\\alpha\\) significance levels in Section 39.5, but first let’s fully conduct a hypothesis test corresponding to our genre popularity activity using the infer package. 39.4 Conducting hypothesis tests In Section 36.2.2, we showed you how to construct confidence intervals. We first illustrated how to do this using dplyr data wrangling verbs and the rep_sample_n() function from Subsection 33.1.3 which we used as a virtual shovel. In particular, we constructed confidence intervals by resampling with replacement by setting the replace = TRUE argument to the rep_sample_n() function. We then showed you how to perform the same task using the infer package workflow. While both workflows resulted in the same bootstrap distribution from which we can construct confidence intervals, the infer package workflow emphasizes each of the steps in the overall process in Figure 39.6. It does so using function names that are intuitively named with verbs: specify() the variables of interest in your data frame. generate() replicates of bootstrap resamples with replacement. calculate() the summary statistic of interest. visualize() the resulting bootstrap distribution and confidence interval. Figure 39.6: Confidence intervals with the infer package. In this section, we will now show you how to seamlessly modify the previously seen infer code for constructing confidence intervals to conduct hypothesis tests. You will notice that the basic outline of the workflow is almost identical, except for an additional hypothesize() step between the specify() and generate() steps, as can be seen in Figure 39.7. Figure 39.7: Hypothesis testing with the infer package. Furthermore, we will use a pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1 for this hypothesis test. Please read the discussion about \\(\\alpha\\) in Subsection 39.1.1 or later on in Section 39.5. 39.4.1 infer package workflow 1. specify variables Recall that we use the specify() verb to specify the response variable and, if needed, any explanatory variables for our study. In this case, since we are interested in any potential effects of genre on popularity rates, we set popular_or_not as the response variable and track_genre as the explanatory variable. We do so using formula = response ~ explanatory where response is the name of the response variable in the data frame and explanatory is the name of the explanatory variable. So in our case it is popular_or_not ~ track_genre. Furthermore, since we are interested in the proportion of songs \"popular\", and not the proportion of songs not popular, we set the argument success to \"popular\". spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) # A tibble: 2,000 × 2 popular_or_not track_genre &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 popular deep-house 2 popular deep-house 3 popular deep-house 4 popular deep-house 5 popular deep-house 6 popular deep-house 7 popular deep-house 8 popular deep-house 9 popular deep-house 10 popular deep-house # ℹ 1,990 more rows Again, notice how the spotify_metal_deephouse data itself does not change, but the Response: popular_or_not (factor) and Explanatory: track_genre (factor) meta-data do. This is similar to how the group_by() verb from dplyr does not change the data, but only adds “grouping” meta-data, as we saw in Section 24.3. We also now focus on only the two columns of interest in the data for our problem at hand with popular_or_not and track_genre. 2. hypothesize the null In order to conduct hypothesis tests using the infer workflow, we need a new step not present for confidence intervals: hypothesize(). Recall from Section 39.3 that our hypothesis test was \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\\\ \\text{vs. } H_A&amp;: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0 \\end{aligned} \\] In other words, the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) corresponding to our “hypothesized universe” stated that there was no difference in genre popularity rates. We can set this null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in our infer workflow using the null argument of the hypothesize() function to either: \"point\" for hypotheses involving a single sample or \"independence\" for hypotheses involving two samples. In our case, since we have two samples (the metal songs and the deep house songs), we set null = \"independence\". spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) Null Hypo... # A tibble: 2,000 × 2 popular_or_not track_genre &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 popular deep-house 2 popular deep-house 3 popular deep-house 4 popular deep-house 5 popular deep-house 6 popular deep-house 7 popular deep-house 8 popular deep-house 9 popular deep-house 10 popular deep-house # ℹ 1,990 more rows Again, the data has not changed yet. This will occur at the upcoming generate() step; we are merely setting meta-data for now. Where do the terms \"point\" and \"independence\" come from? These are two technical statistical terms. The term “point” relates from the fact that for a single group of observations, you will test the value of a single point. Going back to the almonds example, say we wanted to test if the mean weight of all chocolate-covered almonds was equal to 3.5 grams or not. We would be testing the value of a “point” \\(\\mu\\), the mean weight in grams of all chocolate-covered almonds, as follows \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: \\mu = 3.5\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A&amp;: \\mu \\neq 3.5 \\end{aligned} \\] The term “independence” relates to the fact that for two groups of observations, you are testing whether or not the response variable is independent of the explanatory variable that assigns the groups. In our case, we are testing whether the popular_or_not response variable is “independent” of the explanatory variable track_genre. 3. generate replicates After we hypothesize() the null hypothesis, we generate() replicates of “shuffled” datasets assuming the null hypothesis is true. We do this by repeating the shuffling exercise you performed in Section 39.2 several times on the full dataset of 2000 rows. Let’s use the computer to repeat this 1000 times by setting reps = 1000 in the generate() function. However, unlike for confidence intervals where we generated replicates using type = \"bootstrap\" resampling with replacement, we will now perform shuffles/permutations by setting type = \"permute\". Recall that shuffles/permutations are a kind of resampling, but unlike the bootstrap method, they involve resampling without replacement. spotify_generate &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) nrow(spotify_generate) [1] 2000000 The resulting data frame has 2,000,000 rows. This is because we performed shuffles/permutations for each of the 2000 rows 1000 times and \\(2,000,000 = 1000 \\cdot 2000\\). If you explore the spotify_generate data frame with View(), you will notice that the variable replicate indicates which resample each row belongs to. So it has the value 1 2000 times, the value 2 2000 times, all the way through to the value 1000 2000 times. 4. calculate summary statistics Now that we have generated 1000 replicates of “shuffles” assuming the null hypothesis is true, let’s calculate() the appropriate summary statistic for each of our 1000 shuffles. From Section 39.3, point estimates related to hypothesis testing have a specific name: test statistics. Since the unknown population parameter of interest is the difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\), the test statistic here is the difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{f}\\). For each of our 1000 shuffles, we can calculate this test statistic by setting stat = \"diff in props\". Furthermore, since we are interested in \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\) we set order = c(\"metal\", \"deep-house\"). As we stated earlier, the order of the subtraction does not matter, so long as you stay consistent throughout your analysis and tailor your interpretations accordingly. Let’s save the result in a data frame called null_distribution: null_distribution &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) null_distribution Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) Null Hypo... # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.0140000 2 2 -0.0420000 3 3 0.0220000 4 4 -0.0140000 5 5 -0.0180000 6 6 -0.0160000 7 7 0.0160000 8 8 -0.0400000 9 9 0.0140000 10 10 0.0120000 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that we have 1000 values of stat, each representing one instance of \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\) in a hypothesized world of no difference in genre popularity. Observe as well that we chose the name of this data frame carefully: null_distribution. Recall once again from Section 39.3 that sampling distributions when the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is assumed to be true have a special name: the null distribution. What was the observed difference in popularity rates? In other words, what was the observed test statistic \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{f}\\)? Recall from Section 39.2 that we computed this observed difference by hand to be 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4%. We can also compute this value using the previous infer code but with the hypothesize() and generate() steps removed. Let’s save this in obs_diff_prop: obs_diff_prop &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) obs_diff_prop Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0340000 Note that there is also a wrapper function in infer called observe() that can be used to calculate the observed test statistic. However, we chose to use the specify(), calculate(), and hypothesize() functions to help you continue to use the common verbs and build practice with them. spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; observe(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;, stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) Response: popular_or_not (factor) Explanatory: track_genre (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.0340000 5. visualize the p-value The final step is to measure how surprised we are by a difference of 3.4% in a hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. If the observed difference of 0.034 is highly unlikely, then we would be inclined to reject the validity of our hypothesized universe. We start by visualizing the null distribution of our 1000 values of \\(\\widehat{p}_{m} - \\widehat{p}_{d}\\) using visualize() in Figure 39.8. Recall that these are values of the difference in popularity rates assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. This corresponds to being in our hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. visualize(null_distribution, bins = 25) Figure 39.8: Null distribution. Let’s now add what happened in real life to Figure 39.8, the observed difference in popularity rates of 0.563 - 0.529 = 0.034 = 3.4%. However, instead of merely adding a vertical line using geom_vline(), let’s use the shade_p_value() function with obs_stat set to the observed test statistic value we saved in obs_diff_prop. Furthermore, we will set the direction = \"right\" reflecting our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\). Recall our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) is that \\(p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\), stating that there is a difference in popularity rates in favor of metal songs. “More extreme” here corresponds to differences that are “bigger” or “more positive” or “more to the right.” Hence we set the direction argument of shade_p_value() to be \"right\". On the other hand, had our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) been the other possible one-sided alternative \\(p_{m} - p_{d} &lt; 0\\), suggesting popularity in favor of deep house songs, we would have set direction = \"left\". Had our alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) been two-sided \\(p_{m} - p_{d} \\neq 0\\), suggesting discrimination in either direction, we would have set direction = \"both\". visualize(null_distribution, bins = 25) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop, direction = &quot;right&quot;) Figure 39.9: Shaded histogram to show \\(p\\)-value. In the resulting Figure 39.9, the solid dark line marks 0.034 = 3.4%. However, what does the shaded-region correspond to? This is the \\(p\\)-value. Recall the definition of the \\(p\\)-value from Section 39.3: A \\(p\\)-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. So judging by the shaded region in Figure 39.9, it seems we would somewhat rarely observe differences in popularity rates of 0.034 = 3.4% or more in a hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. In other words, the \\(p\\)-value is somewhat small. Hence, we would be inclined to reject this hypothesized universe, or using statistical language we would “reject \\(H_0\\).” What fraction of the null distribution is shaded? In other words, what is the exact value of the \\(p\\)-value? We can compute it using the get_p_value() function with the same arguments as the previous shade_p_value() code: null_distribution |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_prop, direction = &quot;right&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.065 Keeping the definition of a \\(p\\)-value in mind, the probability of observing a difference in popularity rates as large as 0.034 = 3.4% due to sampling variation alone in the null distribution is 0.065 = 6.5%. Since this \\(p\\)-value is smaller than our pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1, we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\). In other words, this \\(p\\)-value is sufficiently small to reject our hypothesized universe of no difference in genre popularity. We instead have enough evidence to change our mind in favor of difference in genre popularity being a likely culprit here. Observe that whether we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or not depends in large part on our choice of significance level \\(\\alpha\\). We will discuss this more in Subsection 39.5.3. 39.4.2 Comparison with confidence intervals One of the great things about the infer package is that we can jump seamlessly between conducting hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals with minimal changes! Recall the code from the previous section that creates the null distribution, which in turn is needed to compute the \\(p\\)-value: null_distribution &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) To create the corresponding bootstrap distribution needed to construct a 90% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\), we only need to make two changes. First, we remove the hypothesize() step since we are no longer assuming a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. We can do this by deleting or commenting out the hypothesize() line of code. Second, we switch the type of resampling in the generate() step to be \"bootstrap\" instead of \"permute\". bootstrap_distribution &lt;- spotify_metal_deephouse |&gt; specify(formula = popular_or_not ~ track_genre, success = &quot;popular&quot;) |&gt; # Change 1 - Remove hypothesize(): # hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; # Change 2 - Switch type from &quot;permute&quot; to &quot;bootstrap&quot;: generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in props&quot;, order = c(&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;deep-house&quot;)) Using this bootstrap_distribution, let’s first compute the percentile-based confidence intervals, as we did in Section 36.2.2: percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distribution |&gt; get_confidence_interval(level = 0.90, type = &quot;percentile&quot;) percentile_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.000355780 0.0701690 Using our shorthand interpretation for 90% confidence intervals, we are 90% “confident” that the true difference in population proportions \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) is between (0, 0.07). Let’s visualize bootstrap_distribution and this percentile-based 90% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) in Figure 39.10. visualize(bootstrap_distribution) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = percentile_ci) Figure 39.10: Percentile-based 90% confidence interval. Notice a key value that is not included in the 90% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\): the value 0 (but just barely!). In other words, a difference of 0 is not included in our net, suggesting that \\(p_{m}\\) and \\(p_{d}\\) are truly different! Furthermore, observe how the entirety of the 90% confidence interval for \\(p_{m} - p_{d}\\) lies above 0, suggesting that this difference is in favor of metal. 39.4.3 There is only one test Let’s recap the steps necessary to conduct a hypothesis test using the terminology, notation, and definitions related to sampling you saw in Section 39.3 and the infer workflow from Subsection 39.4.1: specify() the variables of interest in your data frame. hypothesize() the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). In other words, set a “model for the universe” assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. generate() shuffles assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. In other words, simulate data assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. calculate() the test statistic of interest, both for the observed data and your simulated data. visualize() the resulting null distribution and compute the \\(p\\)-value by comparing the null distribution to the observed test statistic. While this is a lot to digest, especially the first time you encounter hypothesis testing, the nice thing is that once you understand this general framework, then you can understand any hypothesis test. In a famous blog post, computer scientist Allen Downey called this the “There is only one test” framework, for which he created the flowchart displayed in Figure 39.11. Figure 39.11: Allen Downey’s hypothesis testing framework. Notice its similarity with the “hypothesis testing with infer” diagram you saw in Figure 39.7. That is because the infer package was explicitly designed to match the “There is only one test” framework. So if you can understand the framework, you can easily generalize these ideas for all hypothesis-testing scenarios. Whether for population proportions \\(p\\), population means \\(\\mu\\), differences in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\), differences in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\), and as you will see next module, when we explore inference for regression, population regression slopes \\(\\beta_1\\) as well. In fact, it applies more generally even than just these examples to more complicated hypothesis tests and test statistics as well. 39.5 Interpreting hypothesis tests Interpreting the results of hypothesis tests is one of the more challenging aspects of this method for statistical inference. In this section, we will focus on ways to help with deciphering the process and address some common misconceptions. 39.5.1 Two possible outcomes In Section 39.3, we mentioned that given a pre-specified significance level \\(\\alpha\\) there are two possible outcomes of a hypothesis test: If the \\(p\\)-value is less than \\(\\alpha\\), then we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\). If the \\(p\\)-value is greater than or equal to \\(\\alpha\\), we fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). Unfortunately, the latter result is often misinterpreted as “accepting the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\).” While at first glance it may seem that the statements “failing to reject \\(H_0\\)” and “accepting \\(H_0\\)” are equivalent, there actually is a subtle difference. Saying that we “accept the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\)” is equivalent to stating that “we think the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true.” However, saying that we “fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\)” is saying something else: “While \\(H_0\\) might still be false, we do not have enough evidence to say so.” In other words, there is an absence of enough proof. However, the absence of proof is not proof of absence. To further shed light on this distinction, let’s use the United States criminal justice system as an analogy. A criminal trial in the United States is a similar situation to hypothesis tests whereby a choice between two contradictory claims must be made about a defendant who is on trial: The defendant is truly either “innocent” or “guilty.” The defendant is presumed “innocent until proven guilty.” The defendant is found guilty only if there is strong evidence that the defendant is guilty. The phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” is often used as a guideline for determining a cutoff for when enough evidence exists to find the defendant guilty. The defendant is found to be either “not guilty” or “guilty” in the ultimate verdict. In other words, not guilty verdicts are not suggesting the defendant is innocent, but instead that “while the defendant may still actually be guilty, there was not enough evidence to prove this fact.” Now let’s make the connection with hypothesis tests: Either the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) or the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) is true. Hypothesis tests are conducted assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. We reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\) only if the evidence found in the sample suggests that \\(H_A\\) is true. The significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is used as a guideline to set the threshold on just how strong of evidence we require. We ultimately decide to either “fail to reject \\(H_0\\)” or “reject \\(H_0\\).” So while gut instinct may suggest “failing to reject \\(H_0\\)” and “accepting \\(H_0\\)” are equivalent statements, they are not. “Accepting \\(H_0\\)” is equivalent to finding a defendant innocent. However, courts do not find defendants “innocent,” but rather they find them “not guilty.” Putting things differently, defense attorneys do not need to prove that their clients are innocent, rather they only need to prove that clients are not “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” So going back to our songs activity in Section 39.4, recall that our hypothesis test was \\(H_0: p_{m} - p_{d} = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: p_{m} - p_{d} &gt; 0\\) and that we used a pre-specified significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1. We found a \\(p\\)-value of 0.065. Since the \\(p\\)-value was smaller than \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1, we rejected \\(H_0\\). In other words, we found needed levels of evidence in this particular sample to say that \\(H_0\\) is false at the \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.1 significance level. We also state this conclusion using non-statistical language: we found enough evidence in this data to suggest that there was a difference in the popularity of our two genres of music. 39.5.2 Types of errors Unfortunately, there is some chance a jury or a judge can make an incorrect decision in a criminal trial by reaching the wrong verdict. For example, finding a truly innocent defendant “guilty.” Or on the other hand, finding a truly guilty defendant “not guilty.” This can often stem from the fact that prosecutors do not have access to all the relevant evidence, but instead are limited to whatever evidence the police can find. The same holds for hypothesis tests. We can make incorrect decisions about a population parameter because we only have a sample of data from the population and thus sampling variation can lead us to incorrect conclusions. There are two possible erroneous conclusions in a criminal trial: either (1) a truly innocent person is found guilty or (2) a truly guilty person is found not guilty. Similarly, there are two possible errors in a hypothesis test: either (1) rejecting \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is true, called a Type I error or (2) failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when in fact \\(H_0\\) is false, called a Type II error. Another term used for “Type I error” is “false positive,” while another term for “Type II error” is “false negative.” This risk of error is the price researchers pay for basing inference on a sample instead of performing a census on the entire population. But as we have seen in our numerous examples and activities so far, censuses are often very expensive and other times impossible, and thus researchers have no choice but to use a sample. Thus in any hypothesis test based on a sample, we have no choice but to tolerate some chance that a Type I error will be made and some chance that a Type II error will occur. To help understand the concepts of Type I error and Type II errors, we apply these terms to our criminal justice analogy in Figure 39.12. Figure 39.12: Type I and Type II errors in criminal trials. Thus, a Type I error corresponds to incorrectly putting a truly innocent person in jail, whereas a Type II error corresponds to letting a truly guilty person go free. Let’s show the corresponding table in Figure 39.13 for hypothesis tests. Figure 39.13: Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis tests. 39.5.3 How do we choose alpha? If we are using a sample to make inferences about a population, we are operating under uncertainty and run the risk of making statistical errors. These are not errors in calculations or in the procedure used, but errors in the sense that the sample used may lead us to construct a confidence interval that does not contain the true value of the population parameter, for example. In the case of hypothesis testing, there are two well-defined errors: a Type I and a Type II error: A Type I Error is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. The probability of a Type I Error occurring is \\(\\alpha\\), the significance level, which we defined in Subsection 39.1.1 and in Section 39.3 A Type II Error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. The probability of a Type II Error is denoted by \\(\\beta\\). The value of \\(1-\\beta\\) is known as the power of the test. Ideally, we would like to minimize the errors, and we would like \\(\\alpha = 0\\) and \\(\\beta = 0\\). However, this is not possible as there will always be the possibility of committing one of these errors when making a decision based on sample data. Furthermore, these two error probabilities are inversely related. As the probability of a Type I error goes down, the probability of a Type II error goes up. When constructing a hypothesis test, we have control of the probability of committing a Type I Error because we can decide what is the significance level \\(\\alpha\\) we want to use. Once \\(\\alpha\\) has been pre-specified, we try to minimize \\(\\beta\\), the fraction of incorrect non-rejections of the null hypothesis. So for example if we used \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.01, we would be using a hypothesis testing procedure that in the long run would incorrectly reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) one percent of the time. This is analogous to setting the confidence level of a confidence interval. So what value should you use for \\(\\alpha\\)? While different fields of study have adopted different conventions, although \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) is perhaps the most popular threshold, there is nothing special about this or any other number. Please review Subsection 39.1.1 and our discussion about \\(\\alpha\\) and our tolerance for uncertainty. In addition, observe that choosing a relatively small value of \\(\\alpha\\) reduces our chances of rejecting the null hypothesis, and also of committing a Type I Error; but increases the probability of committing a Type II Error. On the other hand, choosing a relatively large value of \\(\\alpha\\) increases the chances of failing to reject the null hypothesis, and also of committing a Type I Error; but reduces the probability of committing a Type II Error. Depending on the problem at hand, we may be willing to have a larger significance level in certain scenarios and a smaller significance level in others. 39.6 Case study: are action or romance movies rated higher? Let’s apply our knowledge of hypothesis testing to answer the question: “Are action or romance movies rated higher on IMDb?”. IMDb is a database on the internet providing information on movie and television show casts, plot summaries, trivia, and ratings. We will investigate if, on average, action or romance movies get higher ratings on IMDb. 39.6.1 IMDb ratings data The movies dataset in the ggplot2movies package contains information on 58,788 movies that have been rated by users of IMDb.com. movies # A tibble: 58,788 × 24 title year length budget rating votes r1 r2 r3 r4 r5 r6 &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 $ 1971 121 NA 6.4 348 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 24.5 2 $1000 a… 1939 71 NA 6 20 0 14.5 4.5 24.5 14.5 14.5 3 $21 a D… 1941 7 NA 8.2 5 0 0 0 0 0 24.5 4 $40,000 1996 70 NA 8.2 6 14.5 0 0 0 0 0 5 $50,000… 1975 71 NA 3.4 17 24.5 4.5 0 14.5 14.5 4.5 6 $pent 2000 91 NA 4.3 45 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 14.5 14.5 7 $windle 2002 93 NA 5.3 200 4.5 0 4.5 4.5 24.5 24.5 8 &#39;15&#39; 2002 25 NA 6.7 24 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 4.5 14.5 9 &#39;38 1987 97 NA 6.6 18 4.5 4.5 4.5 0 0 0 10 &#39;49-&#39;17 1917 61 NA 6 51 4.5 0 4.5 4.5 4.5 44.5 # ℹ 58,778 more rows # ℹ 12 more variables: r7 &lt;dbl&gt;, r8 &lt;dbl&gt;, r9 &lt;dbl&gt;, r10 &lt;dbl&gt;, mpaa &lt;chr&gt;, # Action &lt;int&gt;, Animation &lt;int&gt;, Comedy &lt;int&gt;, Drama &lt;int&gt;, # Documentary &lt;int&gt;, Romance &lt;int&gt;, Short &lt;int&gt; We will focus on a random sample of 68 movies that are classified as either “action” or “romance” movies but not both. We disregard movies that are classified as both so that we can assign all 68 movies into either category. Furthermore, since the original movies dataset was a little messy, we provide a pre-wrangled version of our data in the movies_sample data frame included in the moderndive package. If you are curious, you can look at the necessary data-wrangling code to do this on GitHub. movies_sample # A tibble: 68 × 4 title year rating genre &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 Underworld 1985 3.1 Action 2 Love Affair 1932 6.3 Romance 3 Junglee 1961 6.8 Romance 4 Eversmile, New Jersey 1989 5 Romance 5 Search and Destroy 1979 4 Action 6 Secreto de Romelia, El 1988 4.9 Romance 7 Amants du Pont-Neuf, Les 1991 7.4 Romance 8 Illicit Dreams 1995 3.5 Action 9 Kabhi Kabhie 1976 7.7 Romance 10 Electric Horseman, The 1979 5.8 Romance # ℹ 58 more rows The variables include the title and year the movie was filmed. Furthermore, we have a numerical variable rating, which is the IMDb rating out of 10 stars, and a binary categorical variable genre indicating if the movie was an Action or Romance movie. We are interested in whether Action or Romance movies got a higher rating on average. Let’s perform an exploratory data analysis of this data. Recall from Subsection 21.7.1 that a boxplot is a visualization we can use to show the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable. Another option you saw in Section 21.6 would be to use a faceted histogram. However, in the interest of brevity, let’s only present the boxplot in Figure 39.14. ggplot(data = movies_sample, aes(x = genre, y = rating)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(y = &quot;IMDb rating&quot;) Figure 39.14: Boxplot of IMDb rating vs. genre. Eyeballing Figure 39.14, romance movies have a higher median rating. Do we have reason to believe, however, that there is a significant difference between the mean rating for action movies compared to romance movies? It is hard to say just based on this plot. The boxplot does show that the median sample rating is higher for romance movies, but there is a large amount of overlap between the boxes. Recall that the median is not necessarily the same as the mean, depending on whether the distribution is skewed. Let’s calculate some summary statistics split by the binary categorical variable genre: the number of movies, the mean rating, and the standard deviation split by genre. We will do this using dplyr data wrangling verbs. Notice in particular how we count the number of each type of movie using the n() summary function. movies_sample |&gt; group_by(genre) |&gt; summarize(n = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating), std_dev = sd(rating)) # A tibble: 2 × 4 genre n mean_rating std_dev &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Action 32 5.275 1.36121 2 Romance 36 6.32222 1.60963 Observe that we have 36 movies with an average rating of 6.322 stars and 32 movies with an average rating of 5.275 stars. The difference in these average ratings is thus 6.322 - 5.275 = 1.047. So there appears to be an edge of 1.047 stars in favor of romance movies. The question is, however, are these results indicative of a true difference for all romance and action movies? Or could we attribute this difference to chance sampling variation? 39.6.2 Sampling scenario Let’s now revisit this study in terms of terminology and notation related to sampling we studied in Subsection 33.2.1. The study population is all movies in the IMDb database that are either action or romance (but not both). The sample from this population is the 68 movies included in the movies_sample dataset. Since this sample was randomly taken from the population movies, it is representative of all romance and action movies on IMDb. Thus, any analysis and results based on movies_sample can generalize to the entire population. What are the relevant population parameter and point estimates? We introduce the fourth sampling scenario in Table 39.6. Table 39.6: Scenarios of sampling for inference Scenario Population parameter Notation Point estimate Symbol(s) 1 Population proportion \\(p\\) Sample proportion \\(\\widehat{p}\\) 2 Population mean \\(\\mu\\) Sample mean \\(\\overline{x}\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}\\) 3 Difference in population proportions \\(p_1 - p_2\\) Difference in sample proportions \\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\) 4 Difference in population means \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\) Difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\) or \\(\\widehat{\\mu}_1 - \\widehat{\\mu}_2\\) So, whereas the sampling bowl exercise in Section 33.1 concerned proportions, the almonds exercise in Section 36.2.1 concerned means, the case study on whether yawning is contagious in Section 36.3 and the music genre activity in Section 39.2 concerned differences in proportions, we are now concerned with differences in means. In other words, the population parameter of interest is the difference in population mean ratings \\(\\mu_a - \\mu_r\\), where \\(\\mu_a\\) is the mean rating of all action movies on IMDb and similarly \\(\\mu_r\\) is the mean rating of all romance movies. Additionally the point estimate/sample statistic of interest is the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\), where \\(\\overline{x}_a\\) is the mean rating of the \\(n_a\\) = 32 movies in our sample and \\(\\overline{x}_r\\) is the mean rating of the \\(n_r\\) = 36 in our sample. Based on our earlier exploratory data analysis, our estimate \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\) is \\(5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047\\). So there appears to be a slight difference of -1.047 in favor of romance movies. The question is, however, could this difference of -1.047 be merely due to chance and sampling variation? Or are these results indicative of a true difference in mean ratings for all romance and action movies on IMDb? To answer this question, we will use hypothesis testing. 39.6.3 Conducting the hypothesis test We will be testing: \\[ \\begin{aligned} H_0 &amp;: \\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\\\ \\text{vs } H_A&amp;: \\mu_a - \\mu_r \\neq 0 \\end{aligned} \\] In other words, the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) suggests that both romance and action movies have the same mean rating. This is the “hypothesized universe” we will assume is true. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\) suggests that there is a difference. Unlike the one-sided alternative we used in the popularity exercise \\(H_A: p_m - p_f &gt; 0\\), we are now considering a two-sided alternative of \\(H_A: \\mu_a - \\mu_r \\neq 0\\). Furthermore, we will pre-specify a low significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.001. By setting this value low, all things being equal, there is a lower chance that the \\(p\\)-value will be less than \\(\\alpha\\). Thus, there is a lower chance that we will reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) in favor of the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\). In other words, we will reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in mean ratings for all action and romance movies, only if we have quite strong evidence. This is known as a “conservative” hypothesis testing procedure. 1. specify variables Let’s now perform all the steps of the infer workflow. We first specify() the variables of interest in the movies_sample data frame using the formula rating ~ genre. This tells infer that the numerical variable rating is the outcome variable, while the binary variable genre is the explanatory variable. Note that unlike previously when we were interested in proportions, since we are now interested in the mean of a numerical variable, we do not need to set the success argument. movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) Response: rating (numeric) Explanatory: genre (factor) # A tibble: 68 × 2 rating genre &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 3.1 Action 2 6.3 Romance 3 6.8 Romance 4 5 Romance 5 4 Action 6 4.9 Romance 7 7.4 Romance 8 3.5 Action 9 7.7 Romance 10 5.8 Romance # ℹ 58 more rows Observe at this point that the data in movies_sample has not changed. The only change so far is the newly defined Response: rating (numeric) and Explanatory: genre (factor) meta-data. 2. hypothesize the null We set the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\) by using the hypothesize() function. Since we have two samples, action and romance movies, we set null to be \"independence\" as we described in Section 39.4. movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) Response: rating (numeric) Explanatory: genre (factor) Null Hypothesis: indep... # A tibble: 68 × 2 rating genre &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 3.1 Action 2 6.3 Romance 3 6.8 Romance 4 5 Romance 5 4 Action 6 4.9 Romance 7 7.4 Romance 8 3.5 Action 9 7.7 Romance 10 5.8 Romance # ℹ 58 more rows 3. generate replicates After we have set the null hypothesis, we generate “shuffled” replicates assuming the null hypothesis is true by repeating the shuffling/permutation exercise you performed in Section 39.2. We will repeat this resampling without replacement of type = \"permute\" a total of reps = 1000 times. Feel free to run the code to check out what the generate() step produces. movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; View() 4. calculate summary statistics Now that we have 1000 replicated “shuffles” assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) that both Action and Romance movies on average have the same ratings on IMDb, let’s calculate() the appropriate summary statistic for these 1000 replicated shuffles. From Section 39.3, summary statistics relating to hypothesis testing have a specific name: test statistics. Since the unknown population parameter of interest is the difference in population means \\(\\mu_{a} - \\mu_{r}\\), the test statistic of interest here is the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\). For each of our 1000 shuffles, we can calculate this test statistic by setting stat = \"diff in means\". Furthermore, since we are interested in \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\), we set order = c(\"Action\", \"Romance\"). Let’s save the results in a data frame called null_distribution_movies: null_distribution_movies &lt;- movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;)) null_distribution_movies # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.511111 2 2 0.345833 3 3 -0.327083 4 4 -0.209028 5 5 -0.433333 6 6 -0.102778 7 7 0.387153 8 8 0.168750 9 9 0.257292 10 10 0.334028 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe that we have 1000 values of stat, each representing one instance of \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\). The 1000 values form the null distribution, which is the technical term for the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\) assuming \\(H_0\\) is true. What happened in real life? What was the observed difference in popularity rates? What was the observed test statistic \\(\\overline{x}_{a} - \\overline{x}_{r}\\)? Recall from our earlier data wrangling, this observed difference in means was \\(5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047\\). We can also achieve this using the code that constructed the null distribution null_distribution_movies but with the hypothesize() and generate() steps removed. We save this in obs_diff_means: obs_diff_means &lt;- movies_sample |&gt; specify(formula = rating ~ genre) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;diff in means&quot;, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;)) obs_diff_means Response: rating (numeric) Explanatory: genre (factor) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -1.04722 5. visualize the p-value Lastly, in order to compute the \\(p\\)-value, we have to assess how “extreme” the observed difference in means of -1.047 is. We do this by comparing -1.047 to our null distribution, which was constructed in a hypothesized universe of no true difference in movie ratings. We visualize both the null distribution and the \\(p\\)-value in Figure 39.15. Unlike our example in Subsection 39.4.1 involving music popularity, since we have a two-sided \\(H_A: \\mu_a - \\mu_r \\neq 0\\), we have to allow for both possibilities for more extreme, so we set direction = \"both\". visualize(null_distribution_movies, bins = 10) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_means, direction = &quot;both&quot;) Figure 39.15: Null distribution, observed test statistic, and \\(p\\)-value. Let’s go over the elements of this plot. First, the histogram is the null distribution. Second, the solid line is the observed test statistic, or the difference in sample means we observed in real life of \\(5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047\\). Third, the two shaded areas of the histogram form the \\(p\\)-value, or the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as or more extreme than the observed test statistic assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. What proportion of the null distribution is shaded? In other words, what is the numerical value of the \\(p\\)-value? We use the get_p_value() function to compute this value: null_distribution_movies |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_means, direction = &quot;both&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.004 This \\(p\\)-value of 0.004 is very small. In other words, there is a very small chance that we would observe a difference of 5.275 - 6.322 = -1.047 in a hypothesized universe where there was truly no difference in ratings. But this \\(p\\)-value is larger than our (even smaller) pre-specified \\(\\alpha\\) significance level of 0.001. Thus, we are inclined to fail to reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\). In non-statistical language, the conclusion is: we do not have the evidence needed in this sample of data to suggest that we should reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in mean IMDb ratings between romance and action movies. We, thus, cannot say that a difference exists in romance and action movie ratings, on average, for all IMDb movies. 39.7 Summary and Final Remarks 39.7.1 Theory-based approach for two-sample hypothesis tests As we did previously when we discussed the theory-based approach for confidence intervals or hypothesis tests for the one-sample problem, let’s now discuss some of the theory needed to perform two-sample hypothesis tests. Let’s consider an example of a traditional theory-based method to conduct hypothesis tests. This method relies on the Central Limit Theorem and properties of random variables, expected value, variance, and standard deviation. It is also a direct extension of the one-sample problem discussed in Section 39.1. Theory-based methods have been used for decades when researchers did not have access to computers that could run thousands of calculations quickly and efficiently. Now computing power is more accessible and simulation-based methods are becoming more popular, but researchers in many fields continue to use theory-based methods. The theory-based method we focus on is known as the Welch’s two-sample \\(t\\)-test for testing differences in sample means. The test statistic we use is the two-sample \\(t\\)-statistic, a standardized version of the difference in sample means \\(\\overline{x}_1 - \\overline{x}_2\\). The data we use is once again the movies_sample data of action and romance movies from Section 39.6. Welch’s two-sample t-statistic In Section 33.5, we looked at the sampling distribution for the difference of two sample means. If we let \\(\\overline X_a\\) be the random variable for the sample mean of action films’ rating and \\(\\overline X_r\\) the one for romance film’s rating, the distribution of the difference of these random variables is \\[\\overline X_a - \\overline X_r \\sim Normal \\left(\\mu_a - \\mu_r, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_a^2}{n_a} + \\frac{\\sigma^2_r}{n_r}} \\right)\\] where \\(\\mu_a\\) and \\(\\mu_r\\) are the population mean ratings, \\(\\sigma_a\\) and \\(\\sigma_r\\) the population standard deviations, and \\(n_a\\) and \\(n_r\\) the sample sizes for action and romance genres, respectively. When using the samples, as we did for one-sample problems, we standardize the difference in sample means, \\(\\overline{x}_a - \\overline{x}_r\\), by subtracting its mean (the differences in population means) and dividing by its standard error. This construct a test statistic known as the Welch’s two-sample \\(t\\)-test statistic: \\[t = \\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r) - (\\mu_a - \\mu_r)}{ \\text{SE}(\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r) } = \\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r) - (\\mu_a - \\mu_r)}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} }\\] Observe that the formula for \\(\\text{SE}(\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r)\\) has the sample sizes \\(n_a\\) and \\(n_r\\) in them. So as the sample sizes increase, the standard error goes down. We have seen this characteristic for one-sample problems in Subsections 33.3.4 and 33.4.5 when describing the sample distribution of the sample mean or the sample proportion and in Section 36.1 when discussing the sample size effect on confidence intervals. Let’s state the null and alternative hypotheses for this test: \\[\\begin{aligned}&amp;H_0: &amp;\\mu_a - \\mu_r = 0\\\\&amp;H_A: &amp;\\mu_a - \\mu_r \\ne 0\\end{aligned}\\] The claim under the null hypothesis is that the difference between the population means is zero. This is equivalent to claiming that the means are the same, \\(\\mu_a = \\mu_r\\), which is the typical test, as we try to determine whether or not the population means are different. Yet, the structure of the test allows for testing other differences as well, if needed. The Welch’s two-sample \\(t\\)-test becomes: \\[t = \\dfrac{ (\\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r) - 0}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} } = \\dfrac{ \\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} }\\] Using results based on the Central Limit Theorem, linear combinations of independent random variables, and properties of the expected value, variance, and standard deviation, it can be shown that the Welch’s test statistic follows a \\(t\\) distribution. In Section 36.1.4 we have discussed the properties of the \\(t\\) distribution and in Figure 36.7 we have shown different \\(t\\) distributions with different degrees of freedom. Recall that the \\(t\\) distribution is similar to the standard normal; its density curve is also bell-shaped, and it is symmetric around zero, but the tails of the \\(t\\) distribution are a little thicker (or heavier) than those of the standard normal. This is important for hypothesis testing, since the \\(p\\)-value is calculated from the areas on those tails. Also recall that as the degrees of freedom increase, the \\(t\\)-distribution more and more approximates the standard normal curve. In terms of the Welch’s two-sample \\(t\\)-test, it has been shown that the test statistics follows a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom that can be approximated by \\[ \\widehat{df} = \\left( \\dfrac{s_a^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{s_r^2}{n_r} \\right)^2 \\Bigg/ \\left( \\dfrac{\\left( \\dfrac{s_a^2}{n_a} \\right)^2}{n_a - 1} + \\dfrac{\\left( \\dfrac{s_r^2}{n_r} \\right)^2}{n_r - 1} \\right) \\] This formula is just too long to enter manually every time that is needed. (A suitable approximation for the degrees of freedom using \\(n_a + n_r - 2\\) is often used instead for reasonably large sample sizes.) But, fortunately, R and other statistical software have already done the formula inputting for us by introducing relevant functions. While it is important to get good approximations to the degrees of freedom in order to get the appropriate \\(p\\)-values, learning this formula goes beyond the reach of those new to statistical inference, and it does little to build the intuition of the \\(t\\)-test. Therefore, we will trust the results that R or other statistical packages provide for us. Let’s compute the \\(t\\)-test statistic. Recall the summary statistics we computed during our exploratory data analysis in Section 39.6.1. movies_sample |&gt; group_by(genre) |&gt; summarize(n = n(), mean_rating = mean(rating), std_dev = sd(rating)) # A tibble: 2 × 4 genre n mean_rating std_dev &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Action 32 5.275 1.36121 2 Romance 36 6.32222 1.60963 Using these values, the observed two-sample \\(t\\)-test statistic is \\[ \\dfrac{ \\bar{x}_a - \\bar{x}_r}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{s_a}^2}{n_a} + \\dfrac{{s_r}^2}{n_r}} } = \\dfrac{5.28 - 6.32}{ \\sqrt{\\dfrac{{1.36}^2}{32} + \\dfrac{{1.61}^2}{36}} } = -2.906 \\] How can we compute the \\(p\\)-value using this theory-based test statistic? We could do it by calculating the degrees of freedom and using the function pt() as we did earlier. Instead, we use the function t_test() from the package infer with the appropriate formula and order, as we did for the simulation-based approach. The results are shown next: movies_sample |&gt; t_test(formula = rating ~ genre, order = c(&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Romance&quot;), alternative = &quot;two-sided&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 7 statistic t_df p_value alternative estimate lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 -2.90589 65.8496 0.00498319 two.sided -1.04722 -1.76677 -0.327671 Based on the \\(p\\)-value = 0.005 we reject the null hypothesis, the average rating for the Romance movies is not the same as the average rating for the Action movies. This result is similar to the one calculated using the simulation-based approach. To be able to use the Welch’s \\(t\\)-test, there are some conditions that are necessary so that the underlying mathematical theory holds: The populations should be close to normal or the samples should be large. Many textbooks suggest the sample sizes to be greater than 30, but there is no clear mathematical foundation for this rule of thumb. In general, as long as the distribution of the samples appear to be close to symmetric, the Welch’s \\(t\\)-test may provide useful results. The samples should be random samples. The sample of one population should be independent from the sample of the other population. Let’s see if these conditions hold for our movies_sample data: This is met since \\(n_a\\) = 32 and \\(n_r\\) = 36 do not seem to be highly skewed and therefore are somewhat symmetric. This is met since we sampled the action and romance movies at random and in an unbiased fashion from the database of all IMDb movies. Unfortunately, we do not know how IMDb computes the ratings. For example, if the same person can rate multiple movies, then those observations may be related. This does not appear to be a major problem in this context though. Assuming all three conditions are not clearly broken, we can be reasonably certain that the theory-based \\(t\\)-test results are valid. 39.7.2 When inference is not needed We have now walked through several different examples of how to use the infer package to perform statistical inference: constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests. For each of these examples, we made it a point to always perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) first; specifically, by looking at the raw data values, by using data visualization with ggplot2, and by data wrangling with dplyr beforehand. We highly encourage you to always do the same. As a beginner to statistics, EDA helps you develop intuition as to what statistical methods like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests can tell us. Even as a seasoned practitioner of statistics, EDA helps guide your statistical investigations. In particular, is statistical inference even needed? Let’s consider an example. Say we are interested in the following question: Of all flights leaving a New York City airport, are Hawaiian Airlines flights in the air for longer than Alaska Airlines flights? Furthermore, let’s assume that 2023 flights are a representative sample of all such flights. Then we can use the flights data frame in the nycflights23 package we introduced in Section 6.4 to answer our question. Let’s filter this data frame to only include Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines using their carrier codes HA and AS: flights_sample &lt;- flights |&gt; filter(carrier %in% c(&quot;HA&quot;, &quot;AS&quot;)) There are two possible statistical inference methods we could use to answer such questions. First, we could construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in population means \\(\\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS}\\), where \\(\\mu_{HA}\\) is the mean air time of all Hawaiian Airlines flights and \\(\\mu_{AS}\\) is the mean air time of all Alaska Airlines flights. We could then check if the entirety of the interval is greater than 0, suggesting that \\(\\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS} &gt; 0\\), or, in other words suggesting that \\(\\mu_{HA} &gt; \\mu_{AS}\\). Second, we could perform a hypothesis test of the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS} = 0\\) versus the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\mu_{HA} - \\mu_{AS} &gt; 0\\). However, let’s first construct an exploratory visualization as we suggested earlier. Since air_time is numerical and carrier is categorical, a boxplot can display the relationship between these two variables, which we display in Figure 39.16. ggplot(data = flights_sample, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = air_time)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Carrier&quot;, y = &quot;Air Time&quot;) Figure 39.16: Air time for Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines flights departing NYC in 2023. This is what we like to call “no PhD in Statistics needed” moments. You do not have to be an expert in statistics to know that Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have notably different air times. The two boxplots do not even overlap! Constructing a confidence interval or conducting a hypothesis test would frankly not provide much more insight than Figure 39.16. Let’s investigate why we observe such a clear-cut difference between these two airlines using data wrangling. Let’s first group the rows of flights_sample not only by carrier but also by destination dest. Subsequently, we will compute two summary statistics: the number of observations using n() and the mean airtime: flights_sample |&gt; group_by(carrier, dest) |&gt; summarize(n = n(), mean_time = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = &quot;keep&quot;) # A tibble: 8 × 4 # Groups: carrier, dest [8] carrier dest n mean_time &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 AS LAS 1 299 2 AS LAX 980 323.929 3 AS PDX 710 326.383 4 AS PSP 18 309.611 5 AS SAN 1034 325.457 6 AS SEA 2417 324.787 7 AS SFO 2683 343.542 8 HA HNL 366 623.287 It turns out that from New York City in 2023 Alaska flew to seven different airports on the West Coast region of the US while Hawaiian only flew to HNL (Honolulu) from NYC. Given the clear difference in distance from New York City to the West Coast versus New York City to Honolulu, it is not surprising that we observe such different (statistically significantly different, in fact) air times in flights. This is a clear example of not needing to do anything more than a simple exploratory data analysis using data visualization and descriptive statistics to get an appropriate conclusion. This is why we highly recommend you perform an EDA of any sample data before running statistical inference methods like confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. 39.7.3 Problems with p-values On top of the many common misunderstandings about hypothesis testing and \\(p\\)-values we listed in Section 39.5, another unfortunate consequence of the expanded use of \\(p\\)-values and hypothesis testing is a phenomenon known as “p-hacking.” p-hacking is the act of “cherry-picking” only results that are “statistically significant” while dismissing those that are not, even if at the expense of the scientific ideas. There are lots of articles written recently about misunderstandings and the problems with \\(p\\)-values. You may wish to check some of them out: Misuse of \\(p\\)-values What a nerdy debate about \\(p\\)-values shows about science – and how to fix it Statisticians issue warning over misuse of \\(P\\) values You cannot trust what you read about nutrition A litany of problems with p-values Such issues were getting so problematic that the American Statistical Association (ASA) put out a statement in 2016 titled “The ASA Statement on Statistical Significance and \\(P\\)-Values,”, with six principles underlying the proper use and interpretation of \\(p\\)-values. The ASA released this guidance on \\(p\\)-values to improve the conduct and interpretation of quantitative science and to inform the growing emphasis on reproducibility of science research. 39.7.4 Additional resources If you want more examples of the infer workflow for conducting hypothesis tests, I suggest you check out the infer package homepage, in particular, a series of example analyses available at https://infer.netlify.app/articles/. 39.7.5 What’s to come Let’s conclude with the infer pipeline for hypothesis testing in Figure 39.17.

The resulting content is licensed under CC BY 4.0. 41.1 Introduction Over the past few weeks, we’ve been emphasizing that data scientists are generally interested in populations—entire collections of people, things, or other phenomena. A data scientist’s goal is to understand something general about everything that fits within a population, and if they have the resources to collect data about the entire population, they would have no particular reason not to do so. The logic behind sampling is practical—it takes a huge amount of resources to collect data on everything, so why not collect data on a subset of everything and use that to draw conclusions about everything? This may—and should—remind you of discussions that we had earlier in the semester about paradigms and the goals of research. The push to understand something general about everything is based on a deeper understanding that the world is more-or-less predictable and that we ought to try to understand predictable, general patterns. Of course, the logic of samples and populations also recognizes that there are differences and diversity within a population—it isn’t that data scientists don’t appreciate that medicines work differently for different people or that what works for one student may not work for another. Instead, it’s that data scientists are hopeful that underneath all of these differences, there are generally reliable patterns that we should understand so that we can understand how the world works in aggregate—and act accordingly to get the results that we want. However, as we also discussed earlier, this isn’t the only way of thinking about the goals of research. Whereas a data scientist sees a sample as a stepping stone to understanding more about a broader population, there are other approaches to research that focus on a small subset of people, things, or other phenomena because they think that small subset has value in and of itself—even (or perhaps especially) if it has less to say about anything outside its relatively limited bounds. As we start to wrap up our semester, we’re going to briefly consider autoethnography, a form of research that is perhaps the polar opposite of data science! Autoethnography is an approach to research and writing that seeks to describe and systematically analyze (graphy) personal experience (auto) in order to understand cultural experience (ethno) (Ellis, 2004; Holman Jones, 2005). Note that the basic relationship between samples and populations here is still more-or-less intact: Someone who conducts an autoethnography examines their personal experience with the hope that it will have something to say about the broader experience of a particular culture or people. However, the terms of that relationship are wildly different: An autoethnographer is confident that in writing about one person (themself), they can unearth enough data to have something to say about something broader. That’s a pretty bold claim, and one that flies in the face of everything we’ve said so far about sampling. Because it’s such a bold claim, I want to make it clear that this chapter is not an unreserved endorsement of autoethnography or an argument that people should write autoethnographies instead of doing data science. I happen to like the idea of autoethnography—and recently got the chance to write one—but I’m also very aware of its shortcomings. In fact, there is plenty of criticism of autoethnography, including from people who are pretty far away from data science, paradigmatically speaking, and you are welcome to add your own concerns in your annotations of this reading! The point of reading about autoethnography here is not so that you embrace this research method but instead to provide a contrast to what we’ve been doing over the past few weeks: How do different researchers think about how to best understand the world? I hope you’ll come away from this class thinking like data scientists—that’s kind of the point!—but I think it’s just as important to consider other ways of thinking about the world, data, and research. 41.2 The Origins of Autoethnography In the 1980s, an academic perspective called postmodernism led to a bit of a “crisis of confidence” among researchers. In particular, scholars began illustrating how the “facts” and “truths” scientists “found” were impossible to separate from the vocabularies and paradigms the scientists used to represent them (Kuhn, 1996; Rorty, 1982). Scholars became increasingly troubled by social science’s limitations (Ellis &amp; Bochner, 2000). They recognized the impossibility of and lack of desire for universal narratives about how the world works (de Certeau, 1984; Lyotard, 1984). Furthermore, there was an increasing need to resist colonialist, sterile research impulses of authoritatively entering a culture, exploiting cultural members, and then recklessly leaving to write about the culture for monetary and/or professional gain, while disregarding relational ties to cultural members (Conquergood, 1991; Ellis, 2007; Riedmann 1993). This introduced new and abundant opportunities to reform social science (science focused on human behavior) and reimagine the objectives and forms of social science research—but changing the way that researchers do research is a big task. How should this happen? Around this same time, scholars were beginning to look at texts and stories differently. They understood new relationships between authors, audiences, and texts (Barthes, 1977; Derrida, 1978; Radway, 1984). They also realized that stories were complex, constitutive, meaningful phenomena that taught morals and ethics, introduced unique ways of thinking and feeling, and helped people make sense of themselves and others (Adams, 2008; Bochner, 2001, 2002; Fisher, 1984). Gradually, scholars across a wide spectrum of disciplines began to consider what social sciences would become if they were closer to literature than to physics, if they proffered stories rather than theories, and if they were self-consciously value-centered rather than pretending to be value free (Bochner, 1994). Many of these scholars turned to autoethnography because they were seeking a positive response to critiques of accepted ideas about what research is and how research should be done. In particular, they wanted to concentrate on ways of producing meaningful, accessible, and evocative research grounded in personal experience, research that would sensitize readers to forms of representation that deepen our capacity to empathize with people who are different from us (Ellis &amp; Bochner 2000). Autoethnographers recognize the innumerable ways personal experience influences the research process. For instance, a researcher decides who, what, when, where, and how to research, decisions necessarily tied to institutional requirements (e.g., Institutional Review Boards), resources (e.g., funding), and personal circumstance (e.g., a researcher studying cancer because of personal experience with cancer). A researcher may also change names and places for protection (Fine, 1993), compress years of research into a single text, and construct a study in a pre-determined way (e.g., using an introduction, literature review, methods section, findings, and conclusion; Tullis Owen, McRae, Adams &amp; Vitale, 2009). Even though some researchers still assume that research can be done from a neutral, impersonal, and objective stance (Atkinson, 1997; Buzard, 2003; Delamont, 2009), most now recognize that such an assumption never fully holds up (Bochner, 2002; Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2000; Rorty, 1982). Consequently, autoethnography is an approach that acknowledges and accommodates subjectivity, emotionality, and the researcher’s influence on research, rather than hiding from these matters or assuming they don’t exist. Furthermore, scholars began recognizing that different kinds of people possess different assumptions about the world—a multitude of ways of speaking, writing, valuing and believing—and that conventional ways of doing and thinking about research were narrow, limiting, and parochial. Following these conventions, a researcher not only disregards other ways of knowing but also implies that other ways necessarily are unsatisfactory and invalid. Autoethnography, on the other hand, expands and opens up a wider lens on the world, eschewing rigid definitions of what constitutes meaningful and useful research; this approach also helps us understand how the kinds of people we claim, or are perceived, to be influence interpretations of what we study, how we study it, and what we say about our topic (Adams, 2005; Wood, 2009). 41.3 What does Autoethnography Look Like? As a method, autoethnography combines characteristics of autobiography and ethnography. When writing an autobiography, an author retroactively and selectively writes about past experiences. Usually, the author does not live through these experiences solely to make them part of a published document; rather, these experiences are assembled using hindsight (Bruner, 1993; Denzin, 1989, Freeman, 2004). In writing, the author also may interview others as well as consult with texts like photographs, journals, and recordings to help with recall (Delany, 2004; Didion, 2005; Goodall, 2006; Herrmann, 2005). Most often, autobiographers write about “epiphanies”—remembered moments perceived to have significantly impacted the trajectory of a person’s life (Bochner &amp; Ellis, 1992; Couser, 1997; Denzin, 1989), times of existential crises that forced a person to attend to and analyze lived experience (Zaner, 2004), and events after which life does not seem quite the same. While epiphanies are self-claimed phenomena in which one person may consider an experience transformative while another may not, these epiphanies reveal ways a person could negotiate “intense situations” and “effects that linger—recollections, memories, images, feelings—long after a crucial incident is supposedly finished” (Bochner, 1984, p.595). When researchers do ethnography, they study a culture’s relational practices, common values and beliefs, and shared experiences for the purpose of helping insiders (cultural members) and outsiders (cultural strangers) better understand the culture (Maso, 2001). Ethnographers do this by becoming participant observers in the culture—that is, by taking field notes of cultural happenings as well as their part in and others’ engagement with these happenings (Geertz, 1973; Goodall, 2001). An ethnographer also may interview cultural members (Berry, 2005; Nicholas, 2004), examine members’ ways of speaking and relating (Ellis, 1986; Lindquist, 2002), investigate uses of space and place (Corey, 1996; Makagon, 2004; Philipsen, 1976), and/or analyze artifacts such as clothing and architecture (Borchard, 1998), and texts such as books, movies, and photographs (Goodall, 2006; Neumann, 1999; Thomas, 2010). When researchers do autoethnography, they retrospectively and selectively write about epiphanies that stem from, or are made possible by, being part of a culture and/or by possessing a particular cultural identity. However, in addition to telling about experiences, autoethnographers often are required by social science publishing conventions to analyze these experiences. Autoethnographers must not only use their methodological tools and research literature to analyze experience, but also must consider ways others may experience similar epiphanies; they must use personal experience to illustrate facets of cultural experience, and, in so doing, make characteristics of a culture familiar for insiders and outsiders. To accomplish this might require comparing and contrasting personal experience against existing research (Ronai, 1995, 1996), interviewing cultural members (Foster, 2006; Marvasti, 2006; Tillmann-Healy, 2001), and/or examining relevant cultural artifacts (Boylorn, 2008; Denzin, 2006). 41.4 How do Autoethnographers Measure Quality? All researchers are concerned with quality, and one common critique of research methods like autoethnography is that it is difficult to determine the quality of their application. Whereas a data scientist can quantitatively describe the extent to which their sample is representative of the population that they are interested in, an autoethnographer is specifically focusing on one person, with the explicit understanding that to a certain extent, their experiences are unique. This critique isn’t wrong, but it’s also misleading to suggest that autoethnographers aren’t concerned with quality: Instead, they understand the quality of research differently. For example, autoethnographers value narrative truth based on what a story of experience does—how it is used, understood, and responded to for and by us and others as writers, participants, audiences, and humans (Bochner, 1994; Denzin, 1989). Autoethnographers also recognize how what we understand and refer to as “truth” changes as the genre of writing or representing experience changes (e.g., fiction or nonfiction; memoir, history, or science). Moreover, autoethnographers acknowledge the importance of contingency. They know that memory is fallible, that it is impossible to recall or report on events in language that exactly represents how those events were lived and felt. Likewise, they recognize that people who have experienced the “same” event often tell different stories about what happened (Tullis Owen et al., 2009). Consequently, traditional concerns about research quality must be shifted to take these things into account. For an autoethnographer, the narrator’s credibility is important. Could the narrator have had the experiences described, given available “factual evidence”? Does the narrator believe that this is actually what happened to her or him? (Bochner, 2002, p. 86) Has the narrator taken “literary license” to the point that the story is better viewed as fiction than a truthful account? Likewise, autoethnographers want a work to seek verisimilitude: to evoke in readers a feeling that the experience described is lifelike, believable, and possible, a feeling that what has been represented could be true. The story is coherent. It connects readers to writers and provides continuity in their lives. “What matters is the way in which the story enables the reader to enter the subjective world of the teller—to see the world from her or his point of view, even if this world does not ‘match reality’” (Plummer, 2001, p.401). An autoethnography can also be judged in terms of whether it helps readers communicate with others different from themselves or offer a way to improve the lives of participants and readers or the author’s own (Ellis, 2004, p.124). In particular, autoethnographers ask: “How useful is the story?” and “To what uses might the story be put?” (Bochner, 2002). Generalizability is also important to autoethnographers, though not in the traditional, social scientific sense that a sample ought to tell us something more general about a population. Instead, in autoethnography, the focus of generalizability moves from respondents to readers, and is always being tested by readers as they determine if a story speaks to them about their experience or about the lives of others they know; it is determined by whether the (specific) autoethnographer is able to illuminate (general) unfamiliar cultural processes (Ellis &amp; Bochner, 2000; Ellis &amp; Ellingson, 2000). Readers provide validation by comparing their lives to ours, by thinking about how our lives are similar and different and the reasons why, and by feeling that the stories have informed them about unfamiliar people or lives (Ellis, 2004, p.195; Flick, 2010). 41.5 Conclusion As stated earlier, our purpose in reading about autoethnography this week is not necessarily to endorse this method or to say that we ought to be learning autoethnography instead of data science. Instead, our purpose is to compare and contrast—how is the logic of data science similar to and different from autoethnography? In comparing and contrasting, we also have the opportunity to ask ourselves about the strengths and weaknesses of data science. What does data science do better than autoethnography? In contrast, what might autoethnography do better than data science? What do “big data” help demonstrate and prove better than a “small story?” Are there cases in which a “small story” helps make a point better than “big data”? Finally, we also have the opportunity to ask about what data science could learn from autoethnography. How can we better understand and (when appropriate) embrace our own subjectivity as we practice data science? Can data science help us break out of our own perspectives and appreciate those of others?

This time, though, we’re going to take into account the inferential techniques that we’ve been exploring over the past three modules. We will see that when applying linear regression methods on sample data, we can gain insight into the relationships between the response and explanatory variables of an entire population. Needed packages If needed, read Section 6.3 for information on how to install and load R packages. library(tidyverse) library(moderndive) library(infer) library(gridExtra) library(GGally) Recall that loading the tidyverse package loads many packages that we have encountered earlier. For details refer to Section 18.4. The packages moderndive and infer contain functions and data frames that will be used in this chapter. 42.1 The simple linear regression model 42.1.1 UN member states revisited Let’s briefly review the example of UN member states covered in Section 27.2. Data on the current UN member states, as of 2024, can be found in the un_member_states_2024 data frame included in the moderndive package. As we did in Section 27.2, we save these data as a new data frame called UN_data_mod14, select() the required variables, and include rows without missing data using na.omit(): UN_data_mod14 &lt;- un_member_states_2024 |&gt; select(country, life_exp = life_expectancy_2022, fert_rate = fertility_rate_2022)|&gt; na.omit() UN_data_mod14 column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd life_exp 183 numeric 53.6 69.4 73.66 75.2 78.3 86.4 6.84 fert_rate 183 numeric 0.9 1.6 2.48 2.0 3.2 6.6 1.15 Above, we can see a summary of the two numerical variables. Note that there are 183 observations without missing values. Using simple linear regression between the fertility rate response variable (fert_rate), or \\(y\\), and the life expectancy regressor (life_exp), or \\(x\\), the regression line is: \\[ \\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_i. \\] We saw this equation previously, but we’re now adding the subscript \\(i\\) to represent the \\(i\\)th observation or country in the UN dataset. We’ll let \\(i = 1\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(n\\) with \\(n = 183\\) for this UN data. The value \\(x_i\\) represents the life expectancy value for the \\(i\\)th member state, and \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) is the fitted fertility rate for the \\(i\\)th member state. The fitted fertility rate is the result of the regression line and is typically different than the observed response \\(y_i\\). The residual is given as the difference \\(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\). As discussed when we first covered regression, the intercept (\\(b_0\\)) and slope (\\(b_1\\)) are the regression coefficients, such that the regression line is the “best-fitting” line based on the least-squares criterion. In other words, the fitted values \\(\\widehat{y}\\) calculated using the least-squares coefficients (\\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\)) minimize the sum of the squared residuals: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i)^2 \\] As we did several modules ago, we’ll fit the linear regression model. By “fit,” we mean that we’ll calculate the regression coefficients, \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), that minimize the sum of squared residuals. To do this in R, we use the lm() function with the formula fert_rate ~ life_exp and save the solution in simple_model: simple_model &lt;- lm(fert_rate ~ life_exp, data = UN_data_mod14) coef(simple_model) Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 12.613 life_exp b1 -0.137 The regression line is \\(\\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_i = 12.613 - 0.137 \\cdot x_i\\), where \\(x_i\\) is the life expectancy for the \\(i\\)th country and \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) is the corresponding fitted fertility rate. The \\(b_0\\) coefficient is the intercept and has a meaning only if the range of values of the regressor, \\(x_i\\), includes zero. Since life expectancy is always a positive value, the intercept in this example doesn’t make much logical sense, so we won’t bother to interpret it. The \\(b_1\\) coefficient is the slope of the regression line; for any country, if the life expectancy were to increase by about one year, we would expect an associated reduction of the fertility rate by about 0.137 units. We can visualize the relationship of the data observed in Figure 42.1 by plotting the scatterplot of fertility rate against life expectancy for all the UN member states with complete data. We’ll also include the regression line using the least-squares criterion: ggplot(UN_data_mod14, aes(x = life_exp, y = fert_rate)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;Life Expectancy (x)&quot;, y = &quot;Fertility Rate (y)&quot;, title = &quot;Relationship between fertility rate and life expectancy&quot;) + geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se = FALSE, linewidth = 0.5) Figure 42.1: Relationship with regression line. Finally, let’s review how to determine the fitted values and residuals for observations in the dataset. France is one of the UN member states, so let’s suppose we want to determine the fitted fertility rate for France based on the linear regression. We start by determining the location of France in the UN_data_mod14 data frame, using rowid_to_column() and filter() with the variable country equal to “France.” The pull() function converts the row number as a data frame to a single value: UN_data_mod14 |&gt; rowid_to_column() |&gt; filter(country == &quot;France&quot;)|&gt; pull(rowid) [1] 57 France is the 57th member state in UN_data_mod14. Its observed fertility rate and life expectancy are: UN_data_mod14 |&gt; filter(country == &quot;France&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 3 country life_exp fert_rate &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 France 82.59 1.8 France’s life expectancy is \\(x_{57} = 82.59\\) years and the fertility rate is \\(y_{57} =1.8\\). Using the regression line from earlier, we can determine France’s fitted fertility rate: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y}_{57} &amp;= 12.613 - 0.137 \\cdot x_{57}\\\\ &amp;= 12.613 - 0.137 \\cdot 82.59\\\\ &amp;= 1.258. \\end{aligned} \\] Based on our regression line we would expect France’s fertility rate to be 1.258. However, the observed fertility rate for France was 1.8, so the residual for France is \\(y_{57} - \\widehat{y}_{57} = 1.8 - 1.258 = 0.542\\). Using R, we don’t have to manually calculate the fitted values and residual for each UN member state. Instead, we do this directly using the regression model simple_model and the get_regression_points() function. To do this only for France, we filter() the 57th observation in the data frame. simple_model |&gt; get_regression_points() |&gt; filter(ID == 57) ID fert_rate life_exp fert_rate_hat residual 57 1.8 82.6 1.26 0.542 We can retrieve this information for each observation. To demonstrate, here are the first few rows: simple_model |&gt; get_regression_points() # A tibble: 183 × 5 ID fert_rate life_exp fert_rate_hat residual &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 4.3 53.65 5.237 -0.937 2 2 1.4 79.47 1.687 -0.287 3 3 2.7 78.03 1.885 0.815 4 4 5 62.11 4.074 0.926 5 5 1.6 77.8 1.916 -0.316 6 6 1.9 78.31 1.846 0.054 7 7 1.6 76.13 2.146 -0.546 8 8 1.6 83.09 1.189 0.411 9 9 1.5 82.27 1.302 0.198 10 10 1.6 74.15 2.418 -0.818 # ℹ 173 more rows Okay, now that we’ve reviewed regression, let’s now explore how to use this information for statistical inference. 42.1.2 The model As we did when studying confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, let’s consider a problem in the context of a population and associated parameters of interest. We can collect a random sample from this population and use it to estimate these parameters. We assume that this population has a response variable (\\(Y\\)), an explanatory variable (\\(X\\)), and there is a statistical linear relationship between these variables, given by the linear model \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X + \\epsilon,\\] where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the population intercept and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the population slope. These are now the parameters of the model that, alongside the explanatory variable (\\(X\\)), produce the equation of a line. The statistical part of this relationship is given by \\(\\epsilon\\), a random variable called the error term. The error term accounts for the portion of \\(Y\\) that is not explained by the line. We also make assumptions about the distribution of the error term, \\(\\epsilon\\). The assumed expected value of the error term is zero, and the assumed standard deviation is equal to a positive constant called \\(\\sigma\\), or in mathematical terms: \\(E(\\epsilon) = 0\\) and \\(SD(\\epsilon) = \\sigma.\\) Let’s review the meaning of these quantities. If you were to take a large number of observations from this population, we would expect the error terms sometimes to be greater than zero and sometimes less than zero, but on average, be equal to zero. Similarly, some error terms will be very close to zero and others very far from zero, but on average, we would expect them to be roughly \\(\\sigma\\) units away from zero. Remember that the square of the standard deviation is called the variance, so \\(Var(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2\\). The variance of the error term is equal to \\(\\sigma^2\\) regardless of the value of \\(X\\). This property is called homoskedasticity or constancy of the variance. It will be useful later on in our analysis. 42.1.3 Using a sample for inference As we did with confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, we’ll use a sample to estimate the parameters in the population. Let’s use data collected from the Old Faithful Geyser in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA. This dataset contains the duration of the geyser eruption in seconds and the waiting time to the next eruption in minutes. The duration of the current eruption can help determine fairly well the waiting time to the next eruption. For this example, we use a sample of data collected by volunteers and saved on the website https://geysertimes.org/ between June 1st, 2024 and August 19th, 2024. These data are stored in the old_faithful_2024 data frame in the moderndive package. While data collected by volunteers are not a true random sample, as the volunteers could introduce some sort of bias, the eruptions selected by the volunteers had no specific patterns. Furthermore, beyond the individual skill of each volunteer measuring the times appropriately, no response bias or preference seems to be present. Therefore, it seems safe to consider the data a random sample. Here are the first ten rows: old_faithful_2024 # A tibble: 114 × 6 eruption_id date time waiting webcam duration &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1473854 2024-08-19 538 180 Yes 235 2 1473352 2024-08-15 1541 184 Yes 259 3 1473337 2024-08-15 1425 116 Yes 137 4 1473334 2024-08-15 1237 188 Yes 222 5 1473331 2024-08-15 1131 106 Yes 105 6 1473328 2024-08-15 944 187 Yes 180 7 1473207 2024-08-14 1231 182 Yes 244 8 1473201 2024-08-14 1041 190 Yes 278 9 1473137 2024-08-13 1810 138 Yes 249 10 1473108 2024-08-13 1624 186 Yes 262 # ℹ 104 more rows By looking at the first row we can tell, for example, that an eruption on August 19, 2024, at 5:38 AM lasted 235 seconds, and the waiting time for the next eruption was 180 minutes. Let’s now display the summary for these two variables: old_faithful_2024 |&gt; select(duration, waiting) |&gt; tidy_summary() column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd duration 114 numeric 99 180 217 240 259 300 59.0 waiting 114 numeric 102 139 160 176 184 201 29.9 We have a sample of 114 eruptions, lasting between 99 seconds and 300 seconds, and the waiting time to the next eruption was between 102 minutes and 201 minutes. Note that each observation is a pair of values, the value of the explanatory variable (\\(X\\)) and the value of the response (\\(Y\\)). The sample takes the form: \\[\\begin{array}{c} (x_1,y_1)\\\\ (x_2, y_2)\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ (x_n, y_n)\\\\ \\end{array}\\] where, for example, \\((x_2, y_2)\\) is the pair of explanatory and response values, respectively, for the second observation in the sample. More generally, we denote the \\(i\\)th pair by \\((x_i, y_i)\\), where \\(x_i\\) is the observed value of the explanatory variable \\(X\\) and \\(y_i\\) is the observed value of the response variable \\(Y\\). Since the sample has \\(n\\) observations we let \\(i=1\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(n\\). In our example \\(n = 114\\), and \\((x_2, y_2) = (259, 184)\\). Figure 42.2 shows the scatterplot for the entire sample with some transparency set to check for overplotting: Figure 42.2: Scatterplot of relationship of eruption duration and waiting time. The relationship seems positive and, to some extent, linear (that is, in the shape of a straight line). 42.1.4 The method of least squares If the association of these variables is linear or approximately linear, we can apply the linear model described in Subsection 42.1.2 to each observation in the sample: \\[\\begin{aligned} y_1 &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\epsilon_1\\\\ y_2 &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_2 + \\epsilon_2\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\phantom{= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot + \\epsilon_2 +}\\vdots \\\\ y_n &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_n + \\epsilon_n \\end{aligned}\\] We want to be able to use this model to describe the relationship between the explanatory variable and the response, but the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are unknown to us. We can estimate these parameters using the random sample by applying the least-squares method introduced in Section 27.2. We’ll compute the estimators for the intercept (\\(\\beta_0\\)) and slope (\\(\\beta_1\\)) that minimize the sum of squared residuals: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i)\\right]^2.\\] This is an optimization problem; to solve it analytically we require calculus and the topic goes beyond the scope of this book. We’ll consider a sketch of the solution here for those familiar with the method. Using the expression above, we find the partial derivative with respect to \\(\\beta_0\\) and equate that expression to zero, the partial derivative with respect to \\(\\beta_1\\) and equate that expression to zero, and use those two equations to solve for \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). The solutions are the regression coefficients introduced first in Section 27.2: \\(b_0\\) is the estimator of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) is the estimator of \\(\\beta_1\\). They are called the least squares estimators and their mathematical expressions are: \\[b_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)(y_i - \\bar y)}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2} \\text{ and } b_0 = \\bar y - b_1 \\cdot \\bar x.\\] Furthermore, an estimator for the standard deviation of \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is given by \\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[y_i - (b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_i)\\right]^2}{n-2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\right)^2}{n-2}}.\\] These or equivalent calculations are done in R when using the lm() function. For old_faithful_2024 we get the results shown in Table 42.1: # Fit regression model: model_1 &lt;- lm(waiting ~ duration, data = old_faithful_2024) # Get the coefficients and standard deviation for the model coef(model_1) sigma(model_1) Table 42.1: Old Faithful geyser linear regression coefficients Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 79.459 duration b1 0.371 s 20.370 Based on these data, and assuming the linear model is appropriate, we can say that for every additional second that an eruption lasts, the waiting time to the next eruption increases, on average, by 0.37 minutes. All eruptions last longer than zero seconds, so the intercept has no meaningful interpretation in this example. Finally, we roughly expect the waiting time for the next eruption to be 20.37 minutes away from the regression line value, on average. 42.1.5 Properties of the least squares estimators The least squares method produces the best-fitting line by selecting the least squares estimators, \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), that make the sum of residual squares the smallest possible. But the choice of \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) depends on the sample observed. For every random sample taken from the data, different values for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) will be determined. In that sense, the least squares estimators, \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), are random variables and as such, they have very useful properties: \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are unbiased estimators of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), or using mathematical notation: \\(E(b_0) = \\beta_0\\) and \\(E(b_1) = \\beta_1\\). This means that, for some random samples, \\(b_1\\) will be greater than \\(\\beta_1\\) and for others less than \\(\\beta_1\\). On average, \\(b_1\\) will be equal to \\(\\beta_1\\). \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are linear combinations of the observed responses \\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(y_n\\). This means that, for example for \\(b_1\\), there are known constants \\(c_1\\), \\(c_2\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(c_n\\) such that \\(b_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_iy_i\\). \\(s^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). These properties will be useful in the next subsection, once we perform theory-based inference for regression. 42.1.6 Relating basic regression to other methods To wrap-up this section, we’ll be investigating how regression relates to two different statistical techniques. One of them was covered already in this book, the difference in sample means, and the other is new-but-related, ANOVA. We’ll see how both can be represented in the regression framework. Two-sample difference in means The two-sample difference in means is a common statistical technique used to compare the means of two groups as seen in Section 39.6. It is often used to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean response between two groups, such as a treatment group and a control group. The two-sample difference in means can be represented in the regression framework by using a dummy variable to represent the two groups. Let’s again consider the movies_sample data frame in the moderndive package. We’ll compare once more the average rating for the genres of “Action” versus “Romance.” We can use the lm() function to fit a linear model with a dummy variable for the genre and then use get_regression_table(): mod_diff_means &lt;- lm(rating ~ genre, data = movies_sample) get_regression_table(mod_diff_means) Table 42.2: Regression table for two-sample difference in means example term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 5.28 0.265 19.92 0.000 4.746 5.80 genre: Romance 1.05 0.364 2.88 0.005 0.321 1.77 Note from Table 42.2 that p_value for the genre: Romance row is the \\(p\\)-value for the hypothesis test of \\[ H_0: \\text{action and romance have the same mean rating} \\] \\[ H_A: \\text{action and romance have different mean ratings} \\] This \\(p\\)-value result matches closely with what was found in Section 39.6, but here we are using a theory-based approach with a linear model. The estimate for the genre: Romance row is the observed difference in means between the “Action” and “Romance” genres that we also saw in Section 39.6, except the sign is switched since the “Action” genre is the reference level. ANOVA ANOVA, or analysis of variance, is a statistical technique used to compare the means of three or more groups by seeing if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of multiple groups. ANOVA can be represented in the regression framework by using dummy variables to represent the groups. Let’s say we wanted to compare the (numeric) popularity values in the spotify_by_genre data frame from the moderndive package across the genres of country, hip-hop, and rock. We can use the slice_sample() function after narrowing in on our selected columns and filtered rows of interest to see what a few rows of this data frame look like in Table 42.3. spotify_for_anova &lt;- spotify_by_genre |&gt; select(artists, track_name, popularity, track_genre) |&gt; filter(track_genre %in% c(&quot;country&quot;, &quot;hip-hop&quot;, &quot;rock&quot;)) spotify_for_anova |&gt; slice_sample(n = 5) Table 42.3: Five randomly selected rows from spotify_for_anova artists track_name popularity track_genre Counting Crows Mr. Jones 0 rock Luke Bryan Country Girl (Shake It For Me) 2 country Salebarbes Marcher l’plancher - Live 42 country Darius Rucker Wagon Wheel 1 country Billy Joel Vienna 78 rock Before we fit a linear model, let’s take a look at the boxplot of track_genre versus popularity in Figure 42.3 to see if there are any differences in the distributions of the three genres. ggplot(spotify_for_anova, aes(x = track_genre, y = popularity)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = &quot;Genre&quot;, y = &quot;Popularity&quot;) Figure 42.3: Boxplot of popularity by genre. We can also compute the mean popularity grouping by track_genre: mean_popularities_by_genre &lt;- spotify_for_anova |&gt; group_by(track_genre) |&gt; summarize(mean_popularity = mean(popularity)) mean_popularities_by_genre # A tibble: 3 × 2 track_genre mean_popularity &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 country 17.0280 2 hip-hop 37.759 3 rock 19.0010 We can use the lm() function to fit a linear model with dummy variables for the genres. We’ll then use the get_regression_table() function to get the regression table in Table 42.4. mod_anova &lt;- lm(popularity ~ track_genre, data = spotify_for_anova) get_regression_table(mod_anova) Table 42.4: Regression table for ANOVA example term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 17.03 0.976 17.45 0.000 15.114 18.94 track_genre: hip-hop 20.73 1.380 15.02 0.000 18.025 23.44 track_genre: rock 1.97 1.380 1.43 0.153 -0.733 4.68 The estimate for the track_genre: hip-hop and track_genre: rock rows are the differences in means between the “hip-hop” and “country” genres and the “rock” and “country” genres, respectively. The “country” genre is the reference level. These values match up (with some rounding differences) to what is shown in mean_popularities_by_genre. The p_value column corresponds to hip-hop having a statistically higher mean popularity compared to country with a value of close to 0 (reported as 0). It also gives us that rock does not have a statistically significant \\(p\\)-value at 0.153, which would make us inclined to say that rock does not have a significantly higher popularity compared to country. The traditional ANOVA doesn’t give this level of granularity. It can be performed using the aov() function and the anova() function via a pipe (|&gt;): aov(popularity ~ track_genre, data = spotify_for_anova) |&gt; anova() Analysis of Variance Table Response: popularity Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) track_genre 2 261843 130922 137 &lt;0.0000000000000002 *** Residuals 2997 2855039 953 --- Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The small \\(p\\)-value here of 2.2e-16 is very close to 0. In R, e-16 means we should move the decimal place 16 places to the left to interpret, which comes out to 0.0000000000000022. (If it read e+16, we would move the decimal place 16 places to the right instead: 22,000,000,000,000,000). This very small \\(p\\)-value would lead us to reject the null hypothesis that the mean popularities are equal across the three genres. This is consistent with the results we found using the linear model. The traditional ANOVA results do not tell us which means are different from each other though, but the linear model does. ANOVA tells us only that a difference exists in the means of the groups. 42.2 Theory-based inference for simple linear regression This section introduces the conceptual framework needed for theory-based inference for regression and discusses the two most prominent methods for inference: confidence intervals (Subsection 42.2.3) and hypothesis tests (Subsection 42.2.4). Some of this material is slightly more technical than other sections in this chapter, but most of the material is illustrated by working with a real example and interpretations and explanations complement the theory. Subsection 42.2.5 presents the R code needed to calculate relevant quantities for inference. Feel free to read this section first. 42.2.1 Conceptual framework Let’s start by reviewing the assumptions of the linear model. We continue using the old_faithful_2024 to illustrate some of this framework. Recall that we have a random sample of \\(n = 114\\) observations. Since we assume a linear relationship between the duration of an eruption and the waiting time to the next eruption, we can express the linear relationship for the \\(i\\)th observation as \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i\\) for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). Observe that \\(x_i\\) is the duration of the \\(i\\)th eruption in the sample, \\(y_i\\) is the waiting time to the next eruption, and \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the population parameters that are considered constant. The error term \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is a random variable that represents how different the observed response \\(y_i\\) is from the expected response \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i\\). We can illustrate the role of the error term using two observations from our old_faithful_2024 dataset. We assume for now that the linear model is appropriate and truly represents the relationship between duration and waiting times. We select the 49th and 51st observations in our sample by using the function slice() with the corresponding rows: old_faithful_2024 |&gt; slice(c(49, 51)) # A tibble: 2 × 6 eruption_id date time waiting webcam duration &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1469584 2024-07-18 1117 139 Yes 236 2 1469437 2024-07-17 1157 176 Yes 236 Note that the duration time is the same for both observations but the response waiting time is different. Assuming that the linear model is appropriate, both responses can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{aligned} y_{49} &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 236 + \\epsilon_{49}\\\\ y_{51} &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 236 + \\epsilon_{51} \\end{aligned}\\] but \\(y_{49} = 139\\) and \\(y_{51} = 176\\). The difference in responses is due to the error term as it accounts for variation in the response not accounted for by the linear model. In the linear model the error term \\(\\epsilon_i\\) has expected value \\(E(\\epsilon_i) = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(SD(\\epsilon_i) = \\sigma\\). Since a random sample is taken, we assume that any two error terms \\(\\epsilon_i\\) and \\(\\epsilon_j\\) for any two different eruptions \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are independent. In order to perform the theory-based inference we require one additional assumption. We let the error term be normally distributed with an expected value (mean) equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to \\(\\sigma\\): \\[\\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma).\\] The population parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are constants. Similarly, the duration of the \\(i\\)th eruption, \\(x_i\\), is known and also a constant. Therefore, the expression \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i\\) is a constant. By contrast, \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is a normally distributed random variable. The response \\(y_i\\) (the waiting time for the \\(i\\)th eruption to the next) is the sum of the constant \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i\\) and the normally distributed random variable \\(\\epsilon_i\\). Based on properties of random variables and the normal distribution, we can state that \\(y_i\\) is also a normally distribution random variable with mean equal to \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i\\) and standard deviation equal to \\(\\sigma\\): \\[y_i \\sim Normal(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i\\,,\\, \\sigma)\\] for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). Since \\(\\epsilon_i\\) and \\(\\epsilon_j\\) are independent, \\(y_i\\) and \\(y_j\\) are also independent for any \\(i \\ne j\\). In addition, as stated in Subsection 42.1.5, the least-squares estimator \\(b_1\\) is a linear combination of the random variables \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\). So \\(b_1\\) is also a random variable! What does this mean? The coefficient for the slope results from a particular sample of \\(n\\) pairs of duration and waiting times. If we collected a different sample of \\(n\\) pairs, the coefficient for the slope would likely be different due to sampling variation. Imagine that we’d collected many random samples of pairs of duration and waiting times and, using the least-squares method, computed the slope \\(b_1\\) for each of these samples. These slopes would form the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\), which we discussed in Subsection 33.3.4 in the context of sample proportions. What we would learn is that, because \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\) are normally distributed and \\(b_1\\) is a linear combination of these random variables, \\(b_1\\) is also normally distributed. After some calculations that go beyond the scope of this book but take into account properties of the expected value and standard deviation of the responses \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\), it can be shown that: \\[b_1 \\sim Normal \\left(\\beta_1\\,,\\, \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}\\right)\\] That is, \\(b_1\\) is normally distributed with expected value \\(\\beta_1\\) and standard deviation equal to the expression above (inside the parentheses and after the comma). Similarly, \\(b_0\\) is a linear combination of \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\) and using properties of the expected value and standard deviation of the responses, we get: \\[b_0 \\sim Normal \\left(\\beta_0\\,,\\, \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac1n + \\frac{\\bar x^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}\\right)\\] We can also standardize the least-square estimators such that \\[z_0 = \\frac{b_0 - \\beta_0}{\\left(\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac1n + \\frac{\\bar x^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}\\right)}\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad z_1 = \\frac{b_1 - \\beta_1}{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}\\right)}\\] are the corresponding standard normal distributions. 42.2.2 Standard errors for least-squares estimators Recall that when discussing sampling, we established that, due to the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the sample mean \\(\\overline X\\) was approximately normal with mean equal to the parameter \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation equal to \\(\\sigma/\\sqrt n\\). We then used the estimated standard error of \\(\\overline X\\) to construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. We’ll now use an analogous treatment to construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\). Observe in the equations above that the standard deviations for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are constructed using the sample size \\(n\\), the values of the explanatory variables, their means, and the standard deviation of \\(y_i\\) (\\(\\sigma\\)). While most of these values are known to us, \\(\\sigma\\) is typically not. Instead, we’ll estimate \\(\\sigma\\) using the estimator of the standard deviation, \\(s\\), introduced in Subsection 42.1.4. The estimated standard deviation of \\(b_1\\) is called the standard error of \\(b_1\\), and it is given by: \\[SE(b_1) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}.\\] Recall that the standard error is the standard deviation of any point estimate computed from a sample. The standard error of \\(b_1\\) quantifies how much variation the estimator of the slope \\(b_1\\) may have for different random samples. The larger the standard error, the more variation we would expect in the estimated slope \\(b_1\\). Similarly, the standard error of \\(b_0\\) is: \\[SE(b_0) = s\\sqrt{\\frac1n + \\frac{\\bar x^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2}}\\] As we discussed in Subsection 36.1.4, when using the estimator \\(s\\) instead of the parameter \\(\\sigma\\), we are introducing additional uncertainty in our calculations. For example, we can standardize \\(b_1\\) using \\[t = \\frac{b_1 - \\beta_1}{SE(b_1)}.\\] Because we are using \\(s\\) to calculate \\(SE(b_1)\\), the value of the standard error changes from sample to sample, and this additional uncertainty makes the distribution of the test statistic \\(t\\) no longer normal. Instead, it follows a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom. The loss of two degrees of freedom relates to the fact that we are trying to estimate two parameters in the linear model: \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). We are ready to use this information to perform inference for the least-square estimators, \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\). 42.2.3 Confidence intervals for the least-squares estimators A 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) can be thought of as a range of plausible values for the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) of the linear relationship between duration and waiting times. In general, if the sampling distribution of an estimator is normal or approximately normal, the confidence interval for the relevant parameter is \\[ \\text{point estimate} \\pm \\text{margin of error} = \\text{point estimate} \\pm (\\text{critical value} \\cdot \\text{standard error}). \\] The formula for a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) is given by \\(b_1 \\pm q \\cdot SE(b_1)\\) where the critical value \\(q\\) is determined by the level of confidence required, the sample size used, and the corresponding degrees of freedom needed for the \\(t\\)-distribution. Let’s now illustrate how to find the 95% confidence interval for the slope in the Old Faithful example manually, but we’ll see later how to do this directly in R using the function get_regression_table(). First, note that \\(n = 114\\), so the degrees of freedom are \\(n-2 = 112\\). The critical value for a 95% confidence interval on a \\(t\\)-distribution with 112 degrees of freedom is \\(q = 1.981\\). Second, the estimates \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\), and \\(s\\) were found earlier and are shown here again in Table 42.5: Table 42.5: Old Faithful linear regression coefficients Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 79.459 duration b1 0.371 s 20.370 Third, the standard error for \\(b_1\\) using the formula presented earlier is: \\[SE(b_1) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar x)^2}} = \\frac{20.37}{627.583} = 0.032.\\] Finally, the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) is given by: \\[\\begin{aligned} b_1 &amp;\\pm q \\cdot SE(b_1)\\\\ &amp;= 0.371 \\pm 1.981\\cdot 0.032\\\\ &amp;= (0.308 , 0.434) \\end{aligned}\\] We are 95% confident that the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is a number between 0.308 and 0.434. The construction of a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_0\\) follows exactly the same steps using \\(b_0\\), \\(SE(b_0)\\), and the same critical value \\(q\\) as the degrees of freedom for the \\(t\\)-distribution are exactly the same, \\(n-2\\): \\[\\begin{aligned} b_0 &amp;\\pm q \\cdot SE(b_0)\\\\ &amp;= 79.459 \\pm 1.981\\cdot 7.311\\\\ &amp;= (-14.112, 14.854) \\end{aligned}\\] The results of the confidence intervals are valid only if the linear model assumptions are satisfied. We’ll discuss these assumptions in Section 42.2.6. 42.2.4 Hypothesis test for population slope To perform a hypothesis test for \\(\\beta_1\\), the general formulation of a two-sided test is \\[\\begin{aligned} H_0: \\beta_1 = B\\\\ H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne B \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(B\\) is the hypothesized value for \\(\\beta_1\\). Recall the terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis tests we introduced in Section 39.3. A hypothesis test consists of a test between two competing hypotheses: (1) a null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) versus (2) an alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\). Test statistic A test statistic is a point estimator used for hypothesis testing. Here, the t-test statistic is given by \\[t = \\frac{b_1 - B}{SE(b_1)}.\\] This test statistic follows, under the null hypothesis, a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom. A particularly useful test is whether there is a linear association between the explanatory variable and the response, which is equivalent to testing: \\[\\begin{aligned} H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\\\ H_1: \\beta_1 \\ne 0 \\end{aligned}\\] For example, we can use this test to determine whether there is a linear relationship between the duration of the Old Faithful geyser eruptions (duration) and the waiting time to the next eruption (waiting). The null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) assumes that the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is 0. If this is true, then there is no linear relationship between the duration and waiting times. When performing a hypothesis test, we assume that the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) is true and try to find evidence against it based on the data observed. The alternative hypothesis \\(H_A\\), on the other hand, states that the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is not 0, meaning that longer eruption duration may result in greater or smaller waiting times to the next eruption. This suggests either a positive or negative linear relationship between the explanatory variable and the response. Since evidence against the null hypothesis may happen in either direction in this context, we call this a two-sided test. The t-test statistic for this problem is given by: \\[t = \\frac{b_1 - 0}{SE(b_1)} = \\frac{0.371 - 0}{0.032} = 11.594\\] The p-value Recall the terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis tests we discussed in Section 39.3. The definition of the \\(p\\)-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as extreme as or more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. We can intuitively think of the \\(p\\)-value as quantifying how “extreme” the estimated slope is (\\(b_1\\) = 0.371), assuming there is no relationship between duration and waiting times. For a two-sided test, if the test statistic is \\(t = 2\\) for example, the \\(p\\)-value is calculated as the area under the \\(t\\)-curve to the left of \\(-2\\) and to the right of \\(2\\) is shown in Figure 42.4. Figure 42.4: Illustration of a two-sided p-value for a t-test. In our Old Faithful geyser eruptions example, the test statistic for the test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) was \\(t = 11.594\\). The \\(p\\)-value was so small that R simply shows that it is equal to zero. Interpretation Following the hypothesis testing procedure we discussed in Section 39.5, since the \\(p\\)-value was practically 0, for any choice of significance level \\(\\alpha\\), we would reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\). In other words, assuming that there is no linear association between duration and waiting times, the probability of observing a slope as extreme as the one we have attained using our random sample, was practically zero. In conclusion, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between duration and waiting times. We have enough statistical evidence to conclude that there is a linear relationship between these variables. 42.2.5 The regression table in R The least-square estimates, standard errors, test statistics, \\(p\\)-values, and confidence interval bounds discussed in Section 42.2 and Subsections 42.2.1, 42.2.2, 42.2.3, and 42.2.4 can be calculated, all at once, using the R wrapper function get_regression_table() from the moderndive package. For model_1, the output is presented in Table 42.6. get_regression_table(model_1) Table 42.6: The regression table for this model term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 79.459 7.311 10.9 0 64.973 93.944 duration 0.371 0.032 11.4 0 0.307 0.435 Note that the first row in Table 42.6 addresses inferences for the intercept \\(\\beta_0\\), and the second row deals with inference for the slope \\(\\beta_1\\). The headers of the table present the information found for inference: The estimate column contains the least-squares estimates, \\(b_0\\) (first row) and \\(b_1\\) (second row). The std_error contains \\(SE(b_0)\\) and \\(SE(b_1)\\) (the standard errors for \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\)), respectively. We defined these standard errors in Subsection 42.2.2. The statistic column contains the \\(t\\)-test statistic for \\(b_0\\) (first row) and \\(b_1\\) (second row). If we focus on \\(b_1\\), the \\(t\\)-test statistic was constructed using the equation \\[ t = \\frac{b_1 - 0}{SE(b_1)} = 11.594 \\] which corresponds to the hypotheses \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne 0\\). The p_value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic just as extreme as or more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. For this hypothesis test, the \\(t\\)-test statistic was equal to 11.594 and, therefore, the \\(p\\)-value was near zero, suggesting rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. The values lower_ci and upper_ci are the lower and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\). Please refer to previous subsections for the conceptual framework and a more detailed description of these quantities. 42.2.6 Model fit and model assumptions I’ve introduced the linear model alongside assumptions about many of its elements and assumed all along that this is an appropriate representation of the relationship between the response and the explanatory variable. In real-life applications, it is uncertain whether the relationship is appropriately described by the linear model or whether all the assumptions we have introduced are satisfied. Of course, we do not expect the linear model described in this chapter, or any other model, to be a perfect representation of a phenomenon presented in nature. Models are simplifications of reality in that they do not intend to represent exactly the relationship in question but rather provide useful approximations that help improve our understanding of this relationship. Furthermore, we want models that are as simple as possible and still capture relevant features of the natural phenomenon we are studying. This approach is known as the principle of parsimony or Occam’s razor. But even with a simple model like a linear one, we still want to know if it accurately represents the relationship in the data. This is called model fit. In addition, we want to determine whether or not the model assumptions have been met. There are four elements in the linear model we want to check. An acrostic is a composition in which certain letters from each piece form a word or words. To help you remember the four elements, we can use the LINE acrostic: Linearity of relationship between variables Is the relationship between \\(y_i\\) and \\(x_i\\) truly linear for each \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\)? In other words, is the linear model \\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i\\) a good fit? Independence of each of the response values \\(y_i\\) Are \\(y_i\\) and \\(y_j\\) independent for any \\(i \\ne j\\)? Normality of the error terms Is the distribution of the error terms at least approximately normal? Equality or constancy of the variance for \\(y_i\\) (and for the error term \\(\\epsilon_i\\)) Is the variance, or equivalently standard deviation, of the response \\(y_i\\) always the same, regardless of the fitted value (\\(\\widehat{y}_i\\)) or the regressor value (\\(x_i\\))? This can serve as a nice reminder of what to check when using linear regression. To check for Linearity, Normality, and Equal or constant variance, we use the residuals of the linear regression via residual diagnostics as we explain in the next subsection.To check for Independence we can use the residuals if the data was collected using a time sequence or other type of sequences. Otherwise, independence may be achieved by taking a random sample, which eliminates a sequential type of dependency. Let’s start by reviewing how residuals are calculated; then, we’ll look at residual diagnostics via visualizations, use the example of the Old Faithful geyser eruptions to determine whether each of the four LINE elements are met, and discuss the implications. Residuals Recall that given a random sample of \\(n\\) pairs \\((x_1, y_1), \\dots, (x_n,y_n)\\) the linear regression was given by: \\[\\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_i\\] for all the observations \\(i = 1, dots,n\\). Recall that the residual as defined in Subsection 27.2.3, is the observed response minus the fitted value. If we denote the residuals with the letter \\(e\\) we get: \\[e_i = y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\] for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\). Combining these two formulas we get \\[y_i = \\underline{\\widehat{y}_i} + e_i = \\underline{b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x_i} + e_i\\] The resulting formula looks very similar to our linear model: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_i + \\epsilon_i\\] In this context, residuals can be thought of as rough estimates of the error terms. Since many of the assumptions of the linear model are related to the error terms, we can check these assumptions by studying the residuals. In Figure 42.5, we can see one particular residual for the Old Faithful geyser eruption where duration time is the explanatory variable and waiting time is the response. There is an arrow to connect the observed waiting time (a circle) with the fitted waiting time (a square). The vertical distance between these two points (or equivalently, the magnitude of the arrow) is the value of the residual for this observation. Figure 42.5: Example of observed value, fitted value, and residual. We can calculate all the \\(n = 114\\) residuals by applying the get_regression_points() function to the regression model model_1. Observe how the resulting values of residual are roughly equal to waiting - waiting_hat (there may be a slight difference due to rounding error). # Fit regression model: model_1 &lt;- lm(waiting ~ duration, data = old_faithful_2024) # Get regression points: fitted_and_residuals &lt;- get_regression_points(model_1) fitted_and_residuals # A tibble: 114 × 5 ID waiting duration waiting_hat residual &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 180 235 166.666 13.334 2 2 184 259 175.572 8.428 3 3 116 137 130.299 -14.299 4 4 188 222 161.842 26.158 5 5 106 105 118.424 -12.424 6 6 187 180 146.256 40.744 7 7 182 244 170.006 11.994 8 8 190 278 182.623 7.377 9 9 138 249 171.861 -33.861 10 10 186 262 176.686 9.314 # ℹ 104 more rows Residual diagnostics Residual diagnostics are used to verify conditions L, N, and E. While there are more sophisticated statistical approaches that can be used, we’ll focus here on data visualization. One of the most useful plots is a residual plot, which is a scatterplot of the residuals against the fitted values. We use the fitted_and_residuals object to draw the scatterplot using geom_point() with the fitted values (waiting_hat) on the x-axis and the residuals (residual) on the y-axis. In addition, we add titles to our axes with labs() and draw a horizontal line at 0 for reference using geom_hline() and yintercept = 0, as shown in the following code: ggplot(fitted_and_residuals, aes(x = waiting_hat, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;duration&quot;, y = &quot;residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;) In Figure 42.6 we can see this residual plot (right plot) alongside the scatterplot for duration vs waiting (left plot). Note how the residuals on the left plot are determined by the vertical distance between the observed response and the linear regression. On the right plot (residuals), I’ve removed the effect of the linear regression, and the effect of the residuals is seen as the vertical distance from each point to the zero line (y-axis). Using this residuals plot, it is easier to spot patterns or trends that may be in conflict with the assumptions of the model, as we describe next. Figure 42.6: The scatterplot and residual plot for the Old Faithful data. In what follows we’ll see how the residual plot can be used to determine whether the linear model assumptions are met. Linearity of relationship We want to check whether the association between the response \\(y_i\\) and the explanatory variable \\(x_i\\) is Linear. We expect, due to the error term in the model, that the scatterplot of residuals against fitted values shows some random variation, but the variation should not be systematic in any direction and the trend should not show non-linear patterns. A scatterplot of residuals against fitted values showing no patterns but simply a cloud of points that seems randomly assigned in every direction with the residuals’ variation (y-axis) about the same for any fitted values (x-axis) and with points located as much above as below the zero line is called a null plot. Plots of residuals against fitted values or regressors that are null plots do not show any evidence against the assumptions of the model. In other words, if we want our linear model to be adequate, we hope to see null plots when plotting residuals against fitted values. This is largely the case for the Old Faithful geyser example with the residuals against the fitted values (waiting_hat) shown in the right-plot of Figure 42.6. The residual plot is not a null plot as it appears there are some clusters of points as opposed to a complete random assignment, but there are not clear systematic trends in any direction or the appearance of a non-linear relationship. So, based on this plot, we believe that the data does not violate the assumption of linearity. By contrast, assume now that the scatterplot of waiting against duration and its associated residual plot are shown in Figure 42.7. (These are simulated data, not the real thing.) A quick look at the scatterplot and regression line (left plot) could lead us to believe that the regression line is an appropriate summary of the relationship. But if we look carefully, you may notice that the residuals for low values of duration are mostly below the regression line, residuals for values in the middle range of duration are mostly above the regression line, and residuals for large values of duration are again below the regression line. This is the reason we prefer to use plots of residuals against fitted values (right plot) as we have removed the effect of the regression and can focus entirely on the residuals. The points clearly do not form a line, but rather a U-shaped polynomial curve. If this was the real data observed, using the linear regression with these data would produce results that are not valid or adequate. Figure 42.7: Example of a non-linear relationship. Independence of the error terms and the response Another assumption we want to check is the Independence of the response values. If they are not independent, some patterns of dependency may appear in the observed data. The residuals could be used for this purpose too as they are a rough approximation of the error terms. If data was collected in a time sequence or other type of sequence, the residuals may also help us determine lack of independence by plotting the residuals against time. As it happens, the Old Faithful geyser eruption example does have a time component we can use: the old_faithful_2024 dataset contains the date variable. We show the plot of residuals against date (time) in Figure 42.8: Figure 42.8: Scatterplot of date (time) vs residuals for the Old Faithful example. The plot of residuals against time (date) seems to be a null plot. Based on this plot, we could say that the residuals do not exhibit any evidence of dependency. Now, the observations in this dataset are only a subset of all the Old Faithful geyser eruptions that happen during this time frame, and most or all of them are eruptions that do not happened sequentially, one after the next. Each observation in this dataset represents a unique eruption of Old Faithful, with waiting times and duration recorded separately for each event. Since these eruptions occur independently of one another, the residuals derived from the regression of waiting versus duration are also expected to be independent. As discussed in Subsection 42.1.3, we can consider this a random sample. In this case, the assumption of independence seems acceptable. Note that the old_faithful_2024 data do not involve repeated measurements or grouped observations that could lead to dependency issues. Therefore, we can proceed with trusting the regression analysis as we believe that the error terms are not systematically related to one another. While determining lack of independence may not be easy in certain settings, in particular if no time sequence or other sequence measurements are involved, taking a random sample is the golden standard. Normality of the error terms The third assumption we want to check is whether the error terms follow Normal distributions with expected value equal to zero. Using the residuals as a rough estimate of the error term values, we have seen in the right plot of Figure 42.6 that sometimes the residuals are positive and other times negative. We want to see if, on average, the errors equal zero and the shape of their distribution approximate a bell shaped curve. We can use a histogram to visualize the distribution of the residuals: ggplot(fitted_and_residuals, aes(residual)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = &quot;white&quot;) We can also use a quantile-to-quantile plot or QQ-plot. The QQ-plot creates a scatterplot of the quantiles (or percentiles) of the residuals against the quantiles of a normal distribution. If the residuals follow approximately a normal distribution, the scatterplot would be a straight line of 45 degrees. To draw a QQ-plot for the Old Faithful geyser eruptions example, we can use the fitted_and_residuals data frame that contains the residuals of the regression, ggplot() with aes(sample = residual) and the geom_qq() function for drawing the QQ-plot. We’ll also include the function geom_qq_line() to add a 45-degree line for comparison: fitted_and_residuals |&gt; ggplot(aes(sample = residual)) + geom_qq() + geom_qq_line() In Figure 42.9 we can see both the histogram of the residuals including a normal curve for comparison (left plot) and a QQ-plot (right plot): Figure 42.9: Histogram of residuals. The histogram of the residuals shown in Figure 42.9 (left plot) does not appear exactly normal as there are some deviations, such as the highest bin value appearing just to the right of the center. But the histogram does not seem too far from normality either. The QQ-plot (right plot) supports this conclusion: The scatterplot is not exactly on the 45-degree line but it does not deviate much from it either. Let’s compare these results with residuals found by simulation that do not appear to follow normality as shown in Figure 42.10. In this case of the model yielding the clearly non-normal residuals on the right, any results from an inference for regression would not be valid. Figure 42.10: Non-normal residuals. Equality or constancy of variance for errors The final assumption we check is the Equality or constancy of the variance for the error term across all fitted values or regressor values. Constancy of variance is also known as homoskedasticity. Using the residuals again as rough estimates of the error terms, we want to check that the dispersion of the residuals is the same for any fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) or regressor \\(x_i\\). In Figure 42.6, we showed the scatterplot of residuals against fitted values (right plot). We can also produce the scatterplot of residuals against the regressor duration in Figure 42.11: ggplot(fitted_and_residuals, aes(x = duration, y = residual)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.6) + labs(x = &quot;duration&quot;, y = &quot;residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) Figure 42.11: Plot of residuals against the regressor. With the exception of the change of scale on the x-axis, it is equivalent (for visualization purposes) to producing a plot of residuals (\\(e_i\\)) against either the fitted values (\\(\\widehat{y}_i\\)) or the regressor values (\\(x_i\\)). This happens because the fitted values are a linear transformation of the regressor values, \\(\\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1\\cdot x_i\\). Observe the vertical dispersion or spread of the residuals for different values of duration: For duration values between 100 and 150 seconds, the residual values are somewhere between -25 and 40, a spread of about 65 units. For duration values between 150 and 200 seconds, there are only a handful of observations and it is not clear what the spread is. For duration values between 200 and 250 seconds, the residual values are somewhere between -37 and 32, a spread of about 69 units. For duration values between 250 and 300 seconds, the residual values are somewhere between -42 and 27, a spread of about 69 units. The spread is not exactly constant across all values of duration. It seems to be slightly higher for greater values of duration, but there seems to be a larger number of observations for higher values of duration as well. Observe also that there are two or three cluster of points and the dispersion of residuals is not completely uniform. While the residual plot is not exactly a null plot, there is not clear evidence against the assumption of homoskedasticity. We are not surprised to see plots such as this one when dealing with real data. It is possible that the residual plot is not exactly a null plot, because there may be some information we are missing that could improve our model. For example, we could include another regressor in our model. Do not forget that we are using a linear model to approximate the relationship between duration and waiting times, and we do not expect the model to perfectly describe this relationship. When you look at these plots, you are trying to find clear evidence of the data not meeting the assumptions used. This example does not appear to violate the constant variance assumption. In Figure 42.12, we can see an example using simulated data with non-constant variance. Figure 42.12: Example of clearly non-equal variance. Observe how the spread of the residuals increases as the regressor value increases. Lack of constant variance is also known as heteroskedasticity. When heteroskedasticity is present, some of the results such as the standard error of the least-square estimators, confidence intervals, or the conclusion for a related hypothesis test would not be valid. What is the conclusion? We did not find conclusive evidence against any of the assumptions of the model: Linearity of relationship between variables Independence of the error terms Normality of the error terms Equality or constancy of the variance However, this does not mean that our model was perfectly adequate. For example, the residual plot was not a null plot and had some clusters of points that cannot be explained by the model. Overall, though, there were no trends that could be considered clear violations of the assumptions and the conclusions we get from this model may be valid. What do we do when the assumptions are not met? When there are clear violations of the assumptions in the model, all the results found may be suspect. In addition, there may be some remedial measures that can be taken to improve the model. None of these measures will be addressed here in depth as this material extends beyond the scope of this book, but let’s briefly discuss potential solutions for future reference. When the Linearity of the relationship between variables is not met, a simple transformation of the regressor, the response, or both variables may solve the problem. An example of such a transformation is given in Appendix A online. If not, alternative methods such as spline regression, generalized linear models, or non-linear models may be used to address these situations. When additional regressors are available, including other regressors as in multiple linear regression may produce better results. If the Independence assumption is not met, but the dependency is established by a variable within the data at hand, linear mixed-effects models can also be used. These models may also be referred to as hierarchical or multilevel models. Small departures of the Normality of the error terms assumption are not too concerning and most of the results, including those related to confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, may still be valid. On the other hand, when the number of violations to the normality assumption is large, many of the results may no longer be valid. Using the advanced methods suggested earlier here may correct these problems too. When the Equality or constancy of the variance is not met, adjusting the variance by adding weights to individual observations may be possible if relevant information is available that makes those weights known. This method is called weighted linear regression or weighted least squares, and it is a direct extension of the model we have studied. If information of the weights is not available, some methods can be used to provide an estimator for the internal structure of the variance in the model. One of the most popular of these methods is called the sandwich estimator. Checking that the assumptions of the model are satisfied is a key component of regression analysis. Constructing and interpreting confidence intervals as well as conducting hypothesis tests and providing conclusions from the results of hypothesis tests are directly affected by whether or not assumptions are satisfied. At the same time, it is often the case with regression analysis that a level of subjectivity when visualizing and interpreting plots is present, and sometimes we are faced with difficult statistical decisions. So what can be done? We suggest transparency and clarity in communicating results. It is important to highlight important elements that may suggest departures from relevant assumptions, and then provide pertinent conclusions. In this way, the stakeholders of any analysis are aware of the model’s shortcomings and can decide whether or not to agree with the conclusions presented to them. 42.3 Simulation-based inference for simple linear regression In this section, we’ll use the simulation-based methods we previously covered to recreate the values in the regression table. In particular, we’ll use the infer package workflow to Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) using bootstrap resampling with replacement. We did this previously in Sections 36.2.2 with the almonds data and 36.3 with the mythbusters_yawn data. Conduct a hypothesis test of \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\) using a permutation test. We did this previously in Sections 39.4 with the spotify_sample data and 39.6 with the movies_sample IMDb data. 42.3.1 Confidence intervals for the population slope using infer We’ll construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) using the infer workflow outlined in Subsection 36.2.3. Specifically, we’ll first construct the bootstrap distribution for the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) using our single sample of 114 eruptions: specify() the variables of interest in old_faithful_2024 with the formula: waiting ~ duration. generate() replicates by using bootstrap resampling with replacement from the original sample of 114 courses. We generate reps = 1000 replicates using type = \"bootstrap\". calculate() the summary statistic of interest: the fitted slope \\(b_1\\). Using this bootstrap distribution, we’ll construct the 95% confidence interval using the percentile method and (if appropriate) the standard error method as well. It is important to note in this case that the bootstrapping with replacement is done row-by-row. Thus, the original pairs of waiting and duration values are always kept together, but different pairs of waiting and duration values may be resampled multiple times. The resulting confidence interval will denote a range of plausible values for the unknown population slope \\(\\beta_1\\) quantifying the relationship between waiting times and duration for Old Faithful eruptions. Let’s first construct the bootstrap distribution for the fitted slope \\(b_1\\): bootstrap_distn_slope &lt;- old_faithful_2024 |&gt; specify(formula = waiting ~ duration) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) bootstrap_distn_slope Response: waiting (numeric) Explanatory: duration (numeric) # A tibble: 1,000 × 2 replicate stat &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 0.334197 2 2 0.331819 3 3 0.385334 4 4 0.380571 5 5 0.369226 6 6 0.370921 7 7 0.337145 8 8 0.417517 9 9 0.343136 10 10 0.359239 # ℹ 990 more rows Observe how we have 1000 values of the bootstrapped slope \\(b_1\\) in the stat column. Let’s visualize the 1000 bootstrapped values in Figure 42.13. visualize(bootstrap_distn_slope) Figure 42.13: Bootstrap distribution of slope. Observe how the bootstrap distribution is roughly bell-shaped. Recall from Subsection 36.2.1 that the shape of the bootstrap distribution of \\(b_1\\) closely approximates the shape of the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\). Percentile-method First, let’s compute the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) using the percentile method. We’ll do so by identifying the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles which include the middle 95% of values. Recall that this method does not require the bootstrap distribution to be normally shaped. percentile_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distn_slope |&gt; get_confidence_interval(type = &quot;percentile&quot;, level = 0.95) percentile_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.309088 0.425198 The resulting percentile-based 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) of (0.309, 0.425). Standard error method Since the bootstrap distribution in Figure 42.13 appears to be roughly bell-shaped, we can also construct a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) using the standard error method. In order to do this, we need to first compute the fitted slope \\(b_1\\), which will act as the center of our standard error-based confidence interval. While we saw in the regression table in Table 42.6 that this was \\(b_1\\) = 0.371, we can also use the infer pipeline with the generate() step removed to calculate it: observed_slope &lt;- old_faithful_2024 |&gt; specify(waiting ~ duration) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) observed_slope Response: waiting (numeric) Explanatory: duration (numeric) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.371095 We then use the get_ci() function with level = 0.95 to compute the 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\). Note that setting the point_estimate argument to the observed_slope of 0.371 sets the center of the confidence interval. se_ci &lt;- bootstrap_distn_slope |&gt; get_ci(level = 0.95, type = &quot;se&quot;, point_estimate = observed_slope) se_ci # A tibble: 1 × 2 lower_ci upper_ci &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.311278 0.430912 The resulting standard error-based 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) of \\((0.311, 0.431)\\) is slightly different than the percentile-based confidence interval. Note that neither of these confidence intervals contains 0 and that both are entirely located above 0. This is suggesting that there is in fact a meaningful positive relationship between waiting times and duration for Old Faithful eruptions. 42.3.2 Hypothesis test for population slope using infer Let’s now conduct a hypothesis test of \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) vs. \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). We will use the infer package, which follows the hypothesis testing paradigm in the “There is only one test” diagram in Figure 39.11. Let’s first think about what it means for \\(\\beta_1\\) to be zero as assumed in the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\). Recall we said if \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\), then this is saying there is no relationship between the waiting time and duration. Thus, assuming this particular null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) means that in our “hypothesized universe” there is no relationship between waiting and duration. We can therefore shuffle/permute the waiting variable to no consequence. We’ll construct the null distribution of the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) by performing the steps that follow. Recall from Section 39.3 on terminology, notation, and definitions related to hypothesis testing where we defined the null distribution: the sampling distribution of our test statistic \\(b_1\\) assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. specify() the variables of interest in old_faithful_2024 with the formula: waiting ~ duration. hypothesize() the null hypothesis of independence. Recall from Section 39.4 that this is an additional step that needs to be added for hypothesis testing. generate() replicates by permuting/shuffling values from the original sample of 114 eruptions. We generate reps = 1000 replicates using type = \"permute\" here. calculate() the test statistic of interest: the fitted slope \\(b_1\\). In this case, we permute the values of waiting across the values of duration 1000 times. We can do this shuffling/permuting since we assumed a “hypothesized universe” of no relationship between these two variables. Then we calculate the \"slope\" coefficient for each of these 1000 generated samples. null_distn_slope &lt;- old_faithful_2024 |&gt; specify(waiting ~ duration) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) Observe the resulting null distribution for the fitted slope \\(b_1\\) in Figure 42.14. Figure 42.14: Null distribution of slopes. Notice how it is centered at \\(b_1\\) = 0. This is because in our hypothesized universe, there is no relationship between waiting and duration and so \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\). Thus, the most typical fitted slope \\(b_1\\) we observe across our simulations is 0. Observe, furthermore, how there is variation around this central value of 0. # Observed slope b1 &lt;- old_faithful_2024 |&gt; specify(waiting ~ duration) |&gt; calculate(stat = &quot;slope&quot;) b1 Response: waiting (numeric) Explanatory: duration (numeric) # A tibble: 1 × 1 stat &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.371095 Let’s visualize the \\(p\\)-value in the null distribution by comparing it to the observed test statistic of \\(b_1\\) = 0.371 in Figure 42.15. We’ll do this by adding a shade_p_value() layer to the previous visualize() code. Figure 42.15: Null distribution and \\(p\\)-value. Since the observed fitted slope 0.371 falls far to the right of this null distribution and thus the shaded region doesn’t overlap it, we’ll have a \\(p\\)-value of 0. For completeness, however, let’s compute the numerical value of the \\(p\\)-value anyways using the get_p_value() function. Recall that it takes the same inputs as the shade_p_value() function: null_distn_slope |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = b1, direction = &quot;both&quot;) # A tibble: 1 × 1 p_value &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 This matches the \\(p\\)-value of 0 in the regression table. We therefore reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) in favor of the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). We thus have evidence that suggests there is a significant relationship between waiting time and duration values for eruptions of Old Faithful. When the conditions for inference for regression are met and the null distribution has a bell shape, we are likely to see similar results between the simulation-based results we just demonstrated and the theory-based results shown in the regression table. 42.4 The multiple linear regression model 42.4.1 The model We’ll next discuss the extension from a simple to a multiple regression model. We assume that a population has a response variable (\\(Y\\)) and two or more explanatory variables (\\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p\\)) with \\(p \\ge 2\\). The statistical linear relationship between these variables is given by \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p + \\epsilon\\] where \\(\\beta_0\\) is the population intercept and \\(\\beta_j\\) is the population partial slope related to regressor \\(X_j\\). The error term \\(\\epsilon\\) accounts for the portion of \\(Y\\) that is not explained by the line. As in the simple case, we assume that the expected value is \\(E(\\epsilon) = 0\\), the standard deviation is \\(SD(\\epsilon) = \\sigma\\), and the variance is \\(Var(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2\\). The variance and standard deviation are constant regardless of the value of \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_p\\). If you were to take a large number of observations from this population, we’d expect the error terms sometimes to be greater than zero and other times less than zero, but on average equal to zero, give or take \\(\\sigma\\) units away from zero. 42.4.2 Example: coffee quality rating scores As in the case of simple linear regression we use a random sample to estimate the parameters in the population. To illustrate these methods, we use the coffee_quality data frame from the moderndive package. This dataset from the Coffee Quality Institute contains information about coffee rating scores based on ten different attributes: aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, uniformity, clean_cup, sweetness, and overall. In addition, the data frame contains other information such as the moisture_percentage and the coffee’s country and continent_of_origin. We can assume that this is a random sample. We plan to regress total_cup_points (response variable) on the numerical explanatory variables aroma, flavor, and moisture_percentage and the categorical explanatory variable with four categories; Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. Before proceeding, we construct a new data frame called coffee_data by keeping the variables of interest. In addition, the variable continent_of_origin has been read into R with type character, and we want to make it type factor. We do this by using dplyr verbs and including the command as.factor() inside mutate() to make continent_of_origin a factor with the ordering of \"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"North America\", and \"South America\". coffee_data &lt;- coffee_quality |&gt; select(aroma, flavor, moisture_percentage, continent_of_origin, total_cup_points) |&gt; mutate(continent_of_origin = as.factor(continent_of_origin)) Here are the first ten rows of coffee_data: coffee_data # A tibble: 207 × 5 aroma flavor moisture_percentage continent_of_origin total_cup_points &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 8.58 8.5 11.8 South America 89.33 2 8.5 8.5 10.5 Asia 87.58 3 8.33 8.42 10.4 Asia 87.42 4 8.08 8.17 11.8 North America 87.17 5 8.33 8.33 11.6 South America 87.08 6 8.33 8.33 10.7 North America 87 7 8.33 8.17 9.1 Asia 86.92 8 8.25 8.25 10 Asia 86.75 9 8.08 8.08 10.8 Asia 86.67 10 8.08 8.17 11 Africa 86.5 # ℹ 197 more rows By looking at the fourth row, we can tell, for example, that the total_cup_points are 87.17 with aroma score equal to 8.08 points, flavor score equal to 8.17 points, moisture_percentage equal to 11.8%, and North America is the country_of_origin. We can also see a summary for these variables in Table 42.7: coffee_data |&gt; tidy_summary() Table 42.7: Summary of coffee data column n group type min Q1 mean median Q3 max sd aroma 207 numeric 6.50 7.58 7.72 7.67 7.92 8.58 0.288 flavor 207 numeric 6.75 7.58 7.75 7.75 7.92 8.50 0.280 moisture_percentage 207 numeric 0.00 10.10 10.73 10.80 11.50 13.50 1.247 total_cup_points 207 numeric 78.00 82.58 83.71 83.75 84.83 89.33 1.730 continent_of_origin 23 Africa factor continent_of_origin 84 Asia factor continent_of_origin 67 North America factor continent_of_origin 33 South America factor Observe that we have a sample of 207 observations, the total_cup_points ranges from 6.5 to 8.58, the average aroma score was 7.745, and the median flavor score was 10.8. Note that each observation is composed of \\(p+1\\) values: the values for the explanatory variables \\((X_1, \\dots, X_p)\\) and the value for the response (\\(Y\\)). The sample takes the form: \\[\\begin{array}{c} (x_{11}, x_{12},\\dots, x_{1p}, y_1)\\\\ (x_{21}, x_{22},\\dots, x_{2p}, y_2)\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ (x_{n1}, x_{n2},\\dots, x_{np}, y_n)\\\\ \\end{array}\\] where \\((x_{i1}, x_{i2},\\dots, x_{ip}, y_i)\\) are the values of the \\(i\\)th observation in the sample for \\(i=1\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(n\\). Using this notation, for example, \\(x_{i2}\\) is the value of the \\(i\\)th observation in the data for the second explanatory variable \\(X_2\\). In the coffee example \\(n = 207\\) and the value of the second explanatory variable (flavor) for the 4th observation is \\(x_{42} = 11.8\\). We can now create data visualizations. When performing multiple regression it is useful to construct a scatterplot matrix, a matrix that contains the scatterplots for all the variable pair combinations. In R, we can use the function ggpairs() from package GGally to generate a scatterplot matrix and some useful additional information. In Figure 42.16, we present the scatterplot matrix for all the variables of interest. coffee_data |&gt; ggpairs() Figure 42.16: Scatterplot matrix for coffee variables of interest. Let’s first consider the plots with the response (total_cup_points) on the vertical axis. They are located in the last row of plots in the figure. When plotting total_cup_points against aroma (bottom row, leftmost plot) or total_cup_points against flavor (bottom row, second plot from the left), we observe a strong and positive linear relationship. The plot of total_cup_points against moisture_percentage (bottom row, third plot from the left) does not provide much information and it appears that these variables are not associated in any way, but we observe an outlying observation for moisture_percentage around zero. The plot of total_cup_points versus continent_of_origin (bottom row, fourth plot from the left) shows four histograms, one for each factor level; the fourth group seems to have a larger dispersion, even though the number of observations seems smaller. The associated boxplots connecting these two variables (fourth row, rightmost plot) suggest that the first level of the factor (\"Africa\") has a higher mean cup points than the other three. It is often useful to also find any linear associations between numerical regressors as is the case for the scatterplot for aroma against flavor which suggests a strong positive linear association. By contrast, almost no relationship can be found when observing moisture_percentage against either aroma or flavor. The function ggpairs() not only produces these plots, but includes the correlation coefficient for any pair of numerical variables. In this example, the correlation coefficients support the findings from using the scatterplot matrix. The correlations between total_cup_points and aroma (0.87) and total_cup_points and flavor (0.94) are positive and close to one, suggesting a strong positive linear association. Recall that the correlation coefficient is relevant if the association is approximately linear. The correlation between moisture_percentage and any other variable is close to zero, suggesting that moisture_percentage is likely not linearly associated with any other variable (either response or regressor). Note also that the correlation between aroma and flavor (0.82) supports our conclusion of a strong positive association. 42.4.3 Least squares for multiple regression Observe that we have three numerical regressors and one factor (continent_of_origin) with four levels: \"Africa\", \"Asia\", \"North America\", and \"South America\". To introduce the factor levels in the linear model, we represent the factor levels using dummy variables as described in Subsection 30.1.2. These are the dummy variables that we need: \\[\\begin{aligned} D_1 &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the continent of origin is Africa} \\phantom{afdasfd} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right.\\\\ D_2 &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the continent of origin is Asia}\\phantom{asdfasdfa} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right.\\\\ D_3 &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the continent of origin is North America}\\phantom{} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right.\\\\ D_4 &amp;= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if the continent of origin is South America} \\phantom{}\\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise}\\end{array} \\right.\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\] Recall also that we’ll drop the first level since this level will be accounted for by the intercept in the model. As we did in the simple linear case, we’ll assume that linearity between the response and the regressors holds and apply the linear model described in Subsection 42.4.1 to each observation in the sample. If we express the model in terms of the \\(i\\)th observation, we get \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} + \\beta_3 x_{i3} + \\beta_{02}D_{i2} + \\beta_{03}D_{i3} + \\beta_{04}D_{i4} + \\epsilon_i \\] where, for the \\(i\\)th observation in the sample, \\(x_{i1}\\) represents the aroma score, \\(x_{i2}\\) the flavor score, \\(x_{i3}\\) the moisture_percentage, \\(D_{i2}\\) the dummy variable for Asia, \\(D_{i3}\\) the dummy variable for North America, and \\(D_{i4}\\) the dummy variable for South America. Recall that \\(i\\) is the subscript that represents any one observation in the sample. Alternatively, we could present the model for all the observations: \\[\\begin{aligned} y_1 &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{11} + \\beta_2 x_{12} + \\beta_3 x_{13}+ \\beta_{02}D_{12} + \\beta_{03}D_{13} + \\beta_{04}D_{14} + \\epsilon_1\\\\ y_2 &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{21} + \\beta_2 x_{22} + \\beta_3 x_{23}+ \\beta_{02}D_{22} + \\beta_{03}D_{23} + \\beta_{04}D_{24} + \\epsilon_2\\\\ &amp; \\phantom{ a}\\vdots \\\\ y_n &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{n1} + \\beta_2 x_{n2} + \\beta_3 x_{n3}+ \\beta_{02}D_{n2} + \\beta_{03}D_{n3} + \\beta_{04}D_{n4} + \\epsilon_n \\end{aligned}\\] The extension of the least-squares method applied to multiple regression follows. We want to retrieve the coefficient estimators that minimize the sum of squared residuals: \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\beta_2 x_{i2} + \\beta_3 x_{i3}+ \\beta_{02}D_{i2} + \\beta_{03}D_{i3} + \\beta_{04}D_{i4} )\\right]^2.\\] This optimization problem is similar to the simple linear case, and it is solved using calculus. We have more equations to deal with now; seven equations in our coffee example, each connected with the coefficient estimators that need to be estimated. The solutions to this problem are reached by using matrices and matrix calculus, and are the regression coefficients when we discussed multiple regression. They are called the least-squares estimators: \\(b_0\\) is the least-square estimator of \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(b_1\\) is the least-square estimator of \\(\\beta_1\\), etc. The fitted values, residuals, estimator of the variance (\\(s^2\\)), and standard deviation (\\(s\\)), are direct extensions to the simple linear case. In the general case, with \\(p\\) regressors, the fitted values are \\[\\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1 x_{i1} + b_2 x_{i2} + \\dots + b_p x_{ip},\\] the residuals are \\(e_i = y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\), and the model variance estimator is \\[ s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\right)^2}{n-p} \\] where \\(p\\) is the number of coefficients. When applying these formulas to the coffee scores example, the fitted values are \\[\\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1 x_{i1} + b_2 x_{i2} + b_3 x_{i3}+ b_{02}D_{i2} + b_{03}D_{i3} + b_{04}D_{i4}\\,\\,,\\] the variance estimator is \\[\\begin{aligned} s^2 &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[y_i - (b_0 + b_1 x_{i1} + b_2 x_{i2} + b_3 x_{i3}+ b_{02}D_{i2} + b_{03}D_{i3} + b_{04}D_{i4} )\\right]^2}{n-7}\\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\right)^2}{n-7}, \\end{aligned}\\] and the standard deviation estimator is \\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\right)^2}{n-7}}. \\] When we think about the least-square estimators as random variables that depend on the random sample taken, the properties of these estimators are a direct extension of the properties presented for the simple linear case: The least-square estimators are unbiased estimators of the parameters of the model. For example, if we choose \\(\\beta_1\\) (the estimator for the partial slope for aroma), then the expected value is equal to the parameter, \\(E(b_1) = \\beta_1\\). This means that for some random samples the estimated value \\(b_1\\) will be greater than \\(\\beta_1\\), and for others less than \\(\\beta_1\\); but, on average, \\(b_1\\) will be equal to \\(\\beta_1\\). The least-square estimators are linear combinations of the observed responses \\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(y_n\\). For \\(b_3\\), for example, there are known constants \\(c_1\\), \\(c_2\\), \\(\\dots\\), \\(c_n\\) such that \\(b_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_iy_i\\). When using the lm() function, all the necessary calculations are done in R. In Table 42.8, for the coffee example, we get: # Fit regression model: mod_mult &lt;- lm( total_cup_points ~ aroma + flavor + moisture_percentage + continent_of_origin, data = coffee_data ) # Get the coefficients of the model coef(mod_mult) # Get the standard deviation of the model sigma(mod_mult) Table 42.8: Coffee example linear regression coefficients Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 37.321 aroma b1 1.732 flavor b2 4.316 moisture_percentage b3 -0.008 continent_of_originAsia b02 -0.393 continent_of_originNorth America b03 -0.273 continent_of_originSouth America b04 -0.478 s 0.507 If the linear model is appropriate, we can interpret these coefficients as we did in Subsections 30.1.2 and 30.2.2. Recall that the numerical regressors’ coefficients (\\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\)) are partial slopes, each representing the extra effect (or additional effect) of increasing the corresponding regressor by one unit while keeping all the other regressors fixed to some value. For example, using mod_mult, if for a given observation we increase the flavor score by one unit, keeping all the other regressors fixed to some level, the total_cup_points would increase by 4.32 units, on average. This interpretation is only valid for the linear regression model mod_mult. If we decide to change the regressors used, add some or remove others, the model changes and the partial slope for flavor will be different in magnitude and in meaning; do not forget that the partial slope is the additional contribution of flavor when added to a model that includes all the other regressors for that particular model. In addition, observe that mod_mult is a model without interactions, similar to the model described in Subsection 30.1.3. The coefficients for factor levels of continent_of_origin (\\(b_{02}\\), \\(b_{03}\\), and \\(b_{04}\\)) affect only the intercept of the model, based on the category of the observation in question. Recall that the factor levels, in order, are Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. For example, if the fifth observation’s continent of origin is South America (\\(D_{04} = 1\\) and \\(D_{02} = D_{03} = 0\\)), the regression formula is given by \\[\\begin{aligned} \\widehat{y}_5 &amp;= b_0 + b_1 x_{51} + b_2 x_{52} + b_3 x_{53}+ b_{02}D_{52} + b_{03}D_{53} + b_{04}D_{54}\\\\ &amp;= b_0 + b_1 x_{51} + b_2 x_{52} + b_3 x_{53}+ b_{02}\\cdot 0 + b_{03}\\cdot 0 + b_{04}\\cdot 1\\\\ &amp;= (b_0 + b_{04}) + b_1 x_{51} + b_2 x_{52} + b_3 x_{53}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\] and the regression intercept for this observation is estimated to be \\[b_0 + b_{04} = 37.32 + (-0.48) = 36.84.\\] We typically do not expect the scores of all regressors to be zero, but you can always check the range of values that your regressors take. For mod_mult the range of regressors can be extracted by using tidy_summary(). In the following code, using the coffee_data dataset, we select the numerical regressors, use tidy_summary(), and select column name, min, and max to get the range for all regressors coffee_data |&gt; select(aroma, flavor, moisture_percentage) |&gt; tidy_summary() |&gt; select(column, min, max) column min max aroma 6.50 8.58 flavor 6.75 8.50 moisture_percentage 0.00 13.50 As we see, only moisture_percentage includes zero in its range, and we would need all numerical regressors to include zero in order for the intercept to have a special meaning in the context of the problem. Observe that we have decided to use only a subset of regressors and construct a model without interactions. We’ll discuss in Subsection 42.5.5 how we could determine what is the best subset of regressors to use when many are available. We are now ready to discuss inference for multiple linear regression. 42.5 Theory-based inference for multiple linear regression In this section, we introduce some of the conceptual framework needed to understand inference in multiple linear regression. We illustrate this framework using the coffee example and the R function get_regression_table() introduced in Subsection 42.2.5. Inference for multiple linear regression is a natural extension of inference for simple linear regression. Recall that the linear model, for the \\(i\\)th observation is given by \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{i1} + \\dots + \\beta_p x_{ip} + \\epsilon_i\\,.\\] We assume again that the error term is normally distributed with an expected value (mean) equal to zero and a standard deviation equal to \\(\\sigma\\): \\[\\epsilon_i \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma).\\] Since the error term is the only random element in the linear model, the response \\(y_i\\) results from the sum of a constant \\[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{i1} + \\dots + \\beta_p x_{ip}\\] and a random variable: the error term \\(\\epsilon_i\\). Using properties of the normal distribution, the expected value, and the variance (and standard deviation), it can be shown that \\(y_i\\) is also normally distributed with mean equal to \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{i1} + \\dots + \\beta_p x_{ip}\\) and standard deviation equal to \\(\\sigma\\): \\[y_i \\sim Normal(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{i1} + \\dots + \\beta_p x_{ip}\\,,\\, \\sigma)\\] for \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\). We also assume that \\(\\epsilon_i\\) and \\(\\epsilon_j\\) are independent, so \\(y_i\\) and \\(y_j\\) are also independent for any \\(i \\ne j\\). Moreover, the least-squares estimators (\\(b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_p\\)) are linear combinations of the random variables \\(y_1, \\dots, y_n\\) which are normally distributed, as shown above. Again, following properties of the normal distribution, the expected value, and the variance it can be shown that the (least-square) estimators follow a normal distribution, the estimators are unbiased, meaning that the expected value for each estimator is the parameter they are estimating; for example, \\(E(b_1) = \\beta_1\\), or in general \\(E(b_j) = \\beta_j\\) for \\(j = 0,1,\\dots, p\\). the variance and standard deviation of each estimator (\\(b_j\\)), is a function of \\(\\sigma\\), and the observed data for the explanatory variable (the values of the regressors in the sample). For simplicity, the standard deviation of the estimator \\(b_j\\) is denoted by \\(SD(b_j)\\) but remember that it is a function of the standard deviation of the response (\\(\\sigma\\)). Using the information above, the distribution of the (least-squares) estimator \\(b_j\\) is given by \\[b_j \\sim Normal(\\beta_j, SD(b_j))\\] for \\(j = 1, \\dots, p\\). Note also that \\(\\sigma\\) is typically unknown, and it is estimated using the estimated standard deviation \\(s\\) instead of \\(\\sigma\\). The estimated standard deviation for \\(b_j\\) is called the standard error of \\(b_j\\) and written as \\(SE(b_j)\\). Again, remember that the standard error is a function of \\(s\\). The standard errors are shown when applying the get_regression_table() function on a regression model. The output for the model mod_mult in in Table 42.9: get_regression_table(mod_mult) Table 42.9: The regression table for mod_mult term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 37.321 1.116 33.45 0.000 35.121 39.522 aroma 1.732 0.222 7.80 0.000 1.294 2.170 flavor 4.316 0.226 19.09 0.000 3.870 4.762 moisture_percentage -0.008 0.030 -0.27 0.787 -0.067 0.051 continent_of_origin: Asia -0.393 0.121 -3.24 0.001 -0.632 -0.154 continent_of_origin: North America -0.273 0.127 -2.15 0.033 -0.524 -0.023 continent_of_origin: South America -0.478 0.142 -3.38 0.001 -0.757 -0.199 We can see that the standard error for the numerical regressors are \\(SE(b_1) = 0.22\\), \\(SE(b_2) = 0.23\\), and \\(SE(b_3) = 0.03\\). 42.5.1 Model dependency of estimators Many inference methods and results for multiple linear regression are a direct extension of the methods and results discussed in simple linear regression. The most important difference is the fact that the least-square estimators represent partial slopes and their values are dependent on the other regressors in the model. If we change the set of regressors used in a model, the least-squares estimates and its standard errors will likely change as well. And these changes will lead to different confidence interval limits, different test statistics for hypothesis tests, and potentially different conclusions about those regressors. Using the coffee_data example, suppose that we consider the model: \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{i1} + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_{i2} + \\beta_3 x_{i3} + \\epsilon_i\\,\\] where \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\), and \\(\\beta_3\\), are the parameters for the partial slopes of aroma, flavor, and moisture_precentage, respectively. Recall that we assume that the parameters \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\), and \\(\\beta_3\\) are constants, unknown to us, but constants. We use multiple linear regression and find the least-square estimates \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\), respectively. The results using the coffee_data are calculated and stored in the object mod_mult_1 and shown in Table 42.10: # Fit regression model: mod_mult_1 &lt;- lm( total_cup_points ~ aroma + flavor + moisture_percentage, data = coffee_data) # Get the coefficients of the model coef(mod_mult_1) sigma(mod_mult_1) Table 42.10: Coffee example linear regression coefficients with three regressors Coefficients Values (Intercept) b0 36.778 aroma b1 1.800 flavor b2 4.285 moisture_percentage b3 -0.015 s 0.521 Now, assume that we decide instead to construct a model without the regressor flavor, so our model is \\[y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_{i1} + \\beta_3 \\cdot x_{i3} + \\epsilon_i\\,.\\] Using multiple regression we compute the least-square estimates \\(b&#39;_1\\) and \\(b&#39;_3\\), respectively, with the \\(&#39;\\) denoting potentially different coefficient values in this different model. The results using the coffee_data are calculated and stored in the object mod_mult_2 and shown in Table 42.11: # Fit regression model: mod_mult_2 &lt;- lm( total_cup_points ~ aroma + moisture_percentage, data = coffee_data) # Get the coefficients of the model coef(mod_mult_2) sigma(mod_mult_2) Table 42.11: Coffee example linear regression coefficients with two regressors Coefficients Values (Intercept) b’0 44.010 aroma b’1 5.227 moisture_percentage b’3 -0.062 s’ 0.857 Let’s focus on the partial slope for aroma using both models. Observe that in model mod_mult_1, the partial slope for aroma is \\(b_1 = 1.8\\). In model mod_mult_2, the partial slope for aroma is \\(b&#39;_1 = 5.23\\). The results are truly different because the models used in each case are different. Similarly, every other coefficient found is different, the standard deviation estimate is different, and it is possible that the inferential results for confidence intervals or hypothesis tests are different too! Any results, conclusions, and interpretations of a regressor are only valid for the model used. For example, interpretations or conclusions made about aroma and its effects or influence in total_cup_points are entirely dependent on whether we have used mod_mult_1, mod_mult_2, or another model. Never assume that a conclusion from using one model can translate to a different model. In addition, it is important to determine which model is the most adequate. Clearly, not both mod_mult_1 and mod_mult_2 can be correct, and we would like to use the one that is the most appropriate. What if neither mod_mult_1 nor mod_mult_2 are adequate, and we should use another model instead? There are two areas in inferential statistics that address these questions. The first area works with comparisons between two models, one using a subset of regressors from the other, as in the coffee example where mod_mult_1 used the regressors aroma, flavor and moisture_percentage while mod_mult_2 used only two of those regressors: aroma and moisture_percentage. We’ll discuss methods addressing this comparison in Subsection 42.5.3. The second area is called model selection or variable selection and uses alternative methods to determine which model, out of the possible available is the most adequate. 42.5.2 Confidence intervals A 95% confidence interval for any coefficient in multiple linear regression is constructed in exactly the same way as we did for simple linear regression, but we should always interpret them as dependent on the model for which they were attained. For example, the formula for a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1\\) is given by \\(b_1 \\pm q \\cdot SE_{b_1}(s)\\) where the critical value \\(q\\) is determined by the level of confidence required, the sample size used (\\(n\\)), and the corresponding degrees of freedom needed for the \\(t\\)-distribution (\\(n - p\\)). In the coffee example, the model mod_mult contains three numerical regressors (aroma, flavor, and moisture_content), one factor (continent_of_origin), the confidence level is 95%, the sample size is \\(n = 207\\), the number of regression coefficients is \\(p = 7\\): one intercept (\\(b_0\\)), three partial slopes for aroma, flavor and moisture_content (\\(b_1, b_2\\), and \\(b_3\\)), and three coefficients for the factor levels in the model (\\(b_{02}\\), \\(b_{03}\\), and \\(b_{04}\\)). So the degrees of freedom are \\(n - p = 207 - 7 = 200\\). The 95% confidence interval for the partial slope of \\(b_1\\) aroma is determined by \\[\\begin{aligned} b_1 &amp;\\pm q \\cdot SE(b_1)\\\\ = 1.73 &amp;\\pm 1.97\\cdot 0.22\\\\ = (1.29 &amp;, 2.17) \\end{aligned}\\] The interpretation of this interval is the customary: “We are 95% confident that the population partial slope for aroma (\\(\\beta_1\\)) in the model mod_mult is a number between 1.29 and 2.17.” We can find these values using get_regression_table() in model mod_mult. This time, however, we’ll add the argument conf.level = 0.98 to get 98% confidence intervals as shown in Table 42.12. get_regression_table(mod_mult, conf.level = 0.98) Table 42.12: The regression table for mod_mult with 98% level term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 37.321 1.116 33.45 0.000 34.705 39.938 aroma 1.732 0.222 7.80 0.000 1.211 2.252 flavor 4.316 0.226 19.09 0.000 3.786 4.846 moisture_percentage -0.008 0.030 -0.27 0.787 -0.078 0.062 continent_of_origin: Asia -0.393 0.121 -3.24 0.001 -0.678 -0.108 continent_of_origin: North America -0.273 0.127 -2.15 0.033 -0.571 0.025 continent_of_origin: South America -0.478 0.142 -3.38 0.001 -0.810 -0.146 The interpretation for the coefficient for flavor, for example, is: “We are 98% confident that the value of \\(\\beta_2\\) (the population partial slope for flavor) is between 3.79 and 4.85.” 42.5.3 Hypothesis test for a single coefficient The hypothesis test for one coefficient, say \\(\\beta_1\\) in the model, is similar to the one for simple linear regression. The general formulation for a two-sided test is \\[\\begin{aligned} H_0: \\beta_1 = B\\quad \\text{with }\\beta_0, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p \\text{ given and arbitrary.}\\\\ H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne B\\quad \\text{with }\\beta_0, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p \\text{ given and arbitrary.} \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(B\\) is the hypothesized value for \\(\\beta_1\\). I need to emphaize that \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p\\) are given but arbitrary to acknowledge that the test only matters in the context of the appropriate model. Notice also that we can perform a test not only for \\(\\beta_1\\) but for any other parameter. As we did for simple linear regression, the most commonly used test is the one where we check if \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) for any \\(j=0,1,\\dots,p\\). For \\(\\beta_1\\) the two-sided test would be: \\[\\begin{aligned} H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\quad \\text{with }\\beta_0, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p \\text{ given and arbitrary}\\\\ H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne 0\\quad \\text{with }\\beta_0, \\beta_2, \\dots, \\beta_p \\text{ given and arbitrary} \\end{aligned}\\] In simple linear regression, testing for \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) was testing to determine if there was a linear relationship between the response and the only regressor. Now, testing for \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) is testing whether the corresponding regressor should be part of a linear model that already contains all the other regressors. This test can be performed with any of the partial slope parameters. For example, can we use the coffee example and model mod_mult_1 (the model with only three numerical regressors) and perform a test for \\(\\beta_2\\) (the population partial slope for regressor flavor). The hypotheses are: \\[\\begin{aligned} H_0: \\beta_2 = 0\\quad \\text{with }\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_3, \\beta_{02}, \\beta_{03}, \\beta_{04} \\text{ given and arbitrary.}\\\\ H_A: \\beta_2 \\ne 0\\quad \\text{with }\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_3, \\beta_{02}, \\beta_{03}, \\beta_{04} \\text{ given and arbitrary.} \\end{aligned}\\] The relevant code is shown as follows with the output: get_regression_table(mod_mult_1) Table 42.13: The regression table for total_cup_points by aroma + flavor + moisture_percentage term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 36.778 1.095 33.591 0.000 34.619 38.937 aroma 1.800 0.223 8.089 0.000 1.361 2.239 flavor 4.285 0.229 18.698 0.000 3.833 4.737 moisture_percentage -0.015 0.029 -0.499 0.618 -0.072 0.043 The t-test statistic is \\[t = \\frac{b_2 - 0}{SE(b_2)} = \\frac{4.28 - 0}{0.23} = 18.7\\] and using this test statistic, the associated \\(p\\)-value is near zero and R only shows the output as zero. We have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that \\(\\beta_2 = 0\\). Recall that when we reject the null hypothesis we say that the result was statistically significant, and we have enough evidence to conclude the alternative hypothesis (\\(\\beta_2 \\ne 0\\)). This implies that changes in flavor score provide information about the total_cup_points when flavor is added to a model that already contains aroma and moisture_percentage. Table 42.13 provides information for all the coefficients. Observe, in particular, that the test for \\(\\beta_1\\) (aroma) is also statistically significant but the test for \\(\\beta_3\\) (moisture_percentage) is not (\\(p\\)-value = 0.62). For the latter, the conclusion is that there is not statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis that this partial slope was zero. In other words, we have not found evidence that adding moisture_percentage to a model that already includes aroma and flavor helps explaining changes in the response total_cup_points. We can remove the moisture_percentage regressor from the model. 42.5.4 Hypothesis test for model comparison There is another hypothesis test that can be performed for multiple linear regression, a test that compares two models, one with a given set of regressors called the full model and the other with only a subset of those regressors called the reduced model. Using the coffee_data example, suppose that the full model is: \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot X_2 + \\beta_3 \\cdot X_3 + \\epsilon\\] where \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\), and \\(\\beta_3\\) are the parameters for the partial slopes of aroma, flavor, and moisture_precentage, respectively. The multiple linear regression outcomes using the coffee_data dataset on this model are stored in the object mod_mult_1. The reduced model does not contain the regressor flavor and is given by \\[Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X_1 + \\beta_3 \\cdot X_3 + \\epsilon.\\] The multiple linear regression output using this model is stored in the object mod_mult_2. The hypothesis test for comparing the full and reduced models can be written as: \\[\\begin{aligned} H_0:\\quad &amp;Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot X_2 + \\epsilon\\\\ H_A:\\quad &amp;Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot X_2 + \\beta_3 \\cdot X_3 + \\epsilon \\end{aligned}\\] or in words: \\[\\begin{aligned} H_0&amp;:\\quad \\text{the reduced model is adequate}\\\\ H_A&amp;:\\quad \\text{the full model is needed} \\end{aligned}\\] This test is called an ANOVA test or an \\(F\\)-test, because the distribution of the test statistic follows an \\(F\\) distribution. The way it works is that the test compares the sum of squared residuals of both the full and reduced models and determines whether the difference between these models was large enough to suggest that the full model is needed. To get the result of this test in R, we use the R function anova() and enter the reduced model followed by the full model with Table 42.14 providing information for this test. anova(mod_mult_2, mod_mult_1) Table 42.14: ANOVA test for model comparison Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) 204 149.9 203 55.1 1 94.8 350 0 The test statistic is given in the second row for the column F. The test statistic is \\(F =349.6\\) and the associated \\(p\\)-value is near zero. In conclusion, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the full model was needed. The ANOVA test can be used to test more than one regressor at a time. This is useful when you have factors (categorical variables) in your model, as all the factor levels should be tested simultaneously. Let’s use our example again, this time making the full model the model with factor continent_of_origin in addition to all three numerical regressors, and the reduced model is the model without continent_of_origin. These models have been computed already in mod_mult and mod_mult_1, respectively. The ANOVA test is performed as follows with the output given in Table 42.15: anova(mod_mult_1, mod_mult) Table 42.15: ANOVA test for second model comparison Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) 203 55.1 200 51.3 3 3.72 4.83 0.003 Observe in this output that the degrees of freedom are 3, because we are testing three coefficients at the same time, \\(\\beta_{02}\\), \\(\\beta_{03}\\), and \\(\\beta_{04}\\). When we are testing for the inclusion of a factor in the model, we always need to test all the factor levels at once. Based on the output, the test statistic is \\(F =4.83\\) and the associated \\(p\\)-value is \\(0.003\\). We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the full model was needed or, alternatively, that it is appropriate to add the factor continent_of_origin to a model that already has aroma, flavor, and moisture_percentage. 42.5.5 Model fit and diagnostics As we did for simple linear regression, we’ll use the residuals to determine the fit of the model and whether some of the assumptions are not met. In particular, we continue using the plot of residuals against the fitted values and if no model violations are present the plot should be close to a null plot. While most of the treatment and interpretations are similar to those presented for simple linear regression, when the plot of residuals against fitted values is not a null plot, we know that there is some sort of violation to one or more of the assumptions of the model. It is no longer clear what the reason for this is, but at least one assumption is not met. On the other hand, if the residuals-against-fitted-values plot appears to be close to a null plot, none of the assumptions have been broken and we can proceed with the use of this model. Let’s use the coffee example. Recall that we have seen that regressors aroma, flavor, and continent_of_origin were statistically significant, but moisture_percentage was not. So, we’ll create a model only with the relevant regressors called mod_mult_final, determine the residuals, and create a plot of residuals against fitted values and a QQ-plot using the grid.arrange() function from the gridExtra package in Figure 42.17: # Fit regression model: mod_mult_final &lt;- lm(total_cup_points ~ aroma + flavor + continent_of_origin, coffee_data) # Get fitted values and residuals: fit_and_res_mult &lt;- get_regression_points(mod_mult_final) g1 &lt;- fit_and_res_mult |&gt; ggplot(aes(x = total_cup_points_hat, y = residual)) + geom_point() + labs(x = &quot;fitted values (total cup points)&quot;, y = &quot;residual&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = &quot;blue&quot;) g2 &lt;- ggplot(fit_and_res_mult, aes(sample = residual)) + geom_qq() + geom_qq_line(col=&quot;blue&quot;, linewidth = 0.5) grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol=2) Figure 42.17: Residuals vs. fitted values plot and QQ-plot for the multiple regression model. The plot of residuals against fitted values (left) appears to be close to a null plot. This result is desirable because it supports the Linearity condition as no patterns are observed in this plot. The Equal or constant variance also holds as the vertical dispersion seems to be fairly uniform for any fitted values. Since we have assumed the data collected was random and there are no time sequences or other sequences to consider, the assumption of Independence seems to be acceptable too. Finally, the QQ-plot suggests (with the exception of one or two observations) that the residuals follow approximately the normal distribution. We can conclude that this model seems to be good enough to hold the assumptions of the model. This example concludes our treatment of theory-based inference. We now proceed to study the simulation-based inference. 42.6 Simulation-based Inference for multiple linear regression 42.6.1 Confidence intervals for the partial slopes using infer We’ll now use the simulation-based methods you previously learned in the context of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing to compute ranges of plausible values for partial slopes with multiple linear regression. Recall that simulation-based methods provide an alternative to the theory-based methods in that they do not rely on the assumptions of normality or large sample sizes. We’ll use the infer package as we did with simple linear regression in Section 42.3, but this time using the fit() function. Getting the observed fitted model Let’s revisit these ideas using our full model on the coffee_data with the factor of continent_of_origin and three numerical regressors in aroma, flavor, and moisture_percentage. As we did with hypothesis testing, we can retrieve the observed statistic. In this case, we get the observed coefficients of the model using the specify() function on our full model with formula syntax combined with fit(): observed_fit &lt;- coffee_data |&gt; specify( total_cup_points ~ aroma + flavor + moisture_percentage + continent_of_origin ) |&gt; fit() observed_fit # A tibble: 7 × 2 term estimate &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 intercept 37.3214 2 aroma 1.73160 3 flavor 4.31600 4 moisture_percentage -0.00807976 5 continent_of_originAsia -0.392936 6 continent_of_originNorth America -0.273427 7 continent_of_originSouth America -0.478137 As we would expect, these values match up with the values of mod_mult_table given in the first two columns there in Table 42.16: mod_mult_table Table 42.16: The regression table for mod_mult term estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci intercept 37.321 1.116 33.45 0.000 34.705 39.938 aroma 1.732 0.222 7.80 0.000 1.211 2.252 flavor 4.316 0.226 19.09 0.000 3.786 4.846 moisture_percentage -0.008 0.030 -0.27 0.787 -0.078 0.062 continent_of_origin: Asia -0.393 0.121 -3.24 0.001 -0.678 -0.108 continent_of_origin: North America -0.273 0.127 -2.15 0.033 -0.571 0.025 continent_of_origin: South America -0.478 0.142 -3.38 0.001 -0.810 -0.146 The observed_fit values will be our point estimates for the partial slopes in the confidence intervals. Bootstrap distribution for the partial slopes We will now find the bootstrap distribution for the partial slopes using the infer workflow. Just like in Section 42.3.1, we are now resampling entire rows of values to construct the bootstrap distribution for the fitted partial slopes using our full sample of 207 coffees: specify() the variables of interest in coffee_data with the formula: total_cup_points ~ aroma + flavor + moisture_percentage + continent_of_origin. generate() replicates by using bootstrap resampling with replacement from the original sample of 207 coffees. We generate reps = 1000 replicates using type = \"bootstrap\" for a total of \\(207 \\cdot 1000 = 207,000\\) rows. coffee_data |&gt; specify( total_cup_points ~ continent_of_origin + aroma + flavor + moisture_percentage ) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;bootstrap&quot;) Response: total_cup_points (numeric) Explanatory: continent_of_origin (factor... # A tibble: 207,000 × 6 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate total_cup_points continent_of_origin aroma flavor &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 83.25 Africa 7.92 7.67 2 1 83.67 Asia 7.58 7.75 3 1 85.5 Asia 8.17 8.08 4 1 82 North America 7.42 7.42 5 1 84.42 Asia 7.83 8 6 1 86.08 Asia 8.17 8.08 7 1 84.08 North America 7.67 7.83 8 1 83.67 Asia 7.83 7.83 9 1 82.75 North America 7.33 7.5 10 1 84.33 North America 7.83 7.83 # ℹ 206,990 more rows # ℹ 1 more variable: moisture_percentage &lt;dbl&gt; Lastly, fit() models for each of the replicates in the boot_distribution_mlr variable.

This results in a total of 7000 rows in the boot_distribution_mlr data frame. We can visualize the bootstrap distribution for the partial slopes in Figure 42.18. visualize(boot_distribution_mlr) Figure 42.18: Bootstrap distributions of partial slopes. Confidence intervals for the partial slopes As we did in Section 42.3.1, we can construct 95% confidence intervals for the partial slopes. Here, we focus on using the percentile-based method with the get_confidence_interval() function and type = \"percentile\" to construct these intervals. confidence_intervals_mlr &lt;- boot_distribution_mlr |&gt; get_confidence_interval( level = 0.95, type = &quot;percentile&quot;, point_estimate = observed_fit) confidence_intervals_mlr # A tibble: 7 × 3 term lower_ci upper_ci &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 aroma 1.33584 2.13218 2 continent_of_originAsia -0.657425 -0.143179 3 continent_of_originNorth America -0.557557 0.0131542 4 continent_of_originSouth America -0.809466 -0.153730 5 flavor 3.88508 4.74376 6 intercept 34.5254 40.0449 7 moisture_percentage -0.0924515 0.0417502 In reviewing the confidence intervals, we note that the confidence intervals for aroma and flavor do not include 0. This suggests that they are statistically significant. This indicates that aroma and flavor have a meaningful and reliable impact on the response variable in the presence of other predictors. We can also notice that 0 is included in the confidence interval for moisture_percentage. This again provides evidence that it might not be a useful regressor in this multiple linear regression model. This implies that moisture_percentage does not significantly contribute to explaining the variability in the response variable after accounting for other predictors in the model. We can also visualize these confidence intervals. This is done in Figure 42.19. visualize(boot_distribution_mlr) + shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = confidence_intervals_mlr) Figure 42.19: 95% confidence intervals for the partial slopes. 42.6.2 Hypothesis testing for the partial slopes using infer We can also conduct hypothesis tests for the partial slopes in multiple linear regression. We’ll use the permutation test to test the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_i = 0\\) versus the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\beta_i \\neq 0\\) for each of the partial slopes. The infer package constructs the null distribution of the partial slopes under the null hypothesis of independence. Null distribution for the partial slopes We can also compute the null distribution for the partial slopes using the infer workflow. We will shuffle the values of the response variable total_cup_points across the values of the regressors continent_of_origin, aroma, flavor, and moisture_percentage in the coffee_data dataset. This is done under the assumption of independence between the response and the regressors. The syntax is similar to constructing the bootstrap distribution, but we use type = \"permute\" and set hypothesize to null = \"independence\". We’ll set our pseudo-random number generation seed to 2024 in order for the reader to get the same results with the shuffling. set.seed(2024) null_distribution_mlr &lt;- coffee_quality |&gt; specify(total_cup_points ~ continent_of_origin + aroma + flavor + moisture_percentage) |&gt; hypothesize(null = &quot;independence&quot;) |&gt; generate(reps = 1000, type = &quot;permute&quot;) |&gt; fit() null_distribution_mlr # A tibble: 7,000 × 3 # Groups: replicate [1,000] replicate term estimate &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 intercept 82.3301 2 1 continent_of_originAsia -0.193739 3 1 continent_of_originNorth America -0.371403 4 1 continent_of_originSouth America -0.0830341 5 1 aroma -1.21891 6 1 flavor 1.52397 7 1 moisture_percentage -0.0747986 8 2 intercept 82.8068 9 2 continent_of_originAsia -0.239054 10 2 continent_of_originNorth America -0.617409 # ℹ 6,990 more rows Hypothesis tests for the partial slopes We can now conduct hypothesis tests for the partial slopes in multiple linear regression. We can use the permutation test to test the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_i = 0\\) versus the alternative hypothesis \\(H_A: \\beta_i \\neq 0\\) for each of the partial slopes. Let’s use a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). We can visualize the \\(p\\)-values in the null distribution by comparing them to the observed test statistics. We do this by adding a shade_p_value() layer visualize(). visualize(null_distribution_mlr) + shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_fit, direction = &quot;two-sided&quot;) Figure 42.20: Shaded p-values for the partial slopes in this multiple regression. From these visualizations in Figure 42.20, we can surmise that aroma and flavor are statistically significant, as their observed test statistics fall far to the right of the null distribution. On the other hand, moisture_percentage is not statistically significant, as its observed test statistic falls within the null distribution. We can also compute the numerical \\(p\\)-values using the get_p_value() function. null_distribution_mlr |&gt; get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_fit, direction = &quot;two-sided&quot;) # A tibble: 7 × 2 term p_value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 aroma 0.034 2 continent_of_originAsia 0.332 3 continent_of_originNorth America 0.56 4 continent_of_originSouth America 0.352 5 flavor 0 6 intercept 0 7 moisture_percentage 0.918 These results match up with our findings from the visualizations of the shaded \\(p\\)-values with the null distribution and in the regression table in Table 42.13. We reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_i = 0\\) for aroma and flavor, but fail to reject it for moisture_percentage. 42.7 Conclusion 42.7.1 Summary of statistical inference We’ve finished the last two scenarios, which we re-display in Table 42.17.
