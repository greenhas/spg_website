# "They want the content to be easy to find to simplify the whole process with a podcast like theirs where there is lots of content from years prior."

# how does Project Zion Podcast aggregate their content?

---

class: center, middle

# "One major strategy that the team uses is the creation of their website, as it makes it that much easier to find specific content or episodes of their podcast. This can be said as the included navigation systems of a website, such as a search bar, or looking for specific hashtags or series, can help serve as a major aid for finding specific content."

Bryan Coleman

# hierarchical

--

* ## organized like a family tree, with "parent" and "child" content

--

* ## menus and categories are especially helpful here

--

* ## [Project Zion Podcast](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/series/)
    
--

* ## [Fantasy Flight Games website](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/#/universe)

# implicit vs. explicit aggregation

---

class: center, middle

# "Implicit menus are automatically generated based off of the structure of the site. This reduces time for someone to go in and fix up the site all the time. Explicit menus are manually generated and managed, this is gives more control over the site, but maintenance needs more effort compared to implicit menus."

Ben Parsons

# bookshelves vs. menus

---

# implicit vs. explicit aggregation

--

* ## implicit aggregation is built off of _internal_ characteristics of the content

--

* ## explicit aggregation is defined _externally_ to the content itself

---

# static vs. dynamic aggregation

--

* ## static aggregation is hand-picked ahead of time and is arbitrary

--

    * ### [Project Zion series](https://www.projectzionpodcast.org/category/steamers-and-sodas/)


--

* ## dynamic aggregation is automatically-generated "on the fly" and based on criteria


--
    * ### [Ananke theme recommended reads](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-edition-of-my-remixed-data-science-textbook/)
    
--

* ## Canvas modules vs. Canvas To Do

---

# fixed vs. variable aggregation

--

* ### both of these derive from dynamic aggregations

--

* ### a fixed aggregation is the same every time for everyone

--

* ### a variable aggregation changes based on context

--

* ### [YouTube example]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYRp8oP0yiw&list=OLAK5uy_n_KoKi3ioPEsTMStsk_DIjRjvSZwBbIhg)
