class: center, middle

# behaviorist/empiricist view

## "A strong tradition in psychology seeks to characterize knowing as having an organized collection of connections among elementary mental or behavioral units"

# cognitivist view

## "A second view treats knowing as having structures of information and processes that recognize and construct patterns of symbols in order to understand concepts and to exhibit general abilities, such as reasoning, solving problems, and using and understanding language."

Greeno, J., Collins, A., & Resnick, L. (1996). *Cognition and learning*. In D. Berliner & R. Calfee (Eds.), Handbook of educational psychology (pp. 15–46). Macmillan.

# situative view

## "A third perspective on knowing focuses on the way knowledge is distributed in the world among individuals, the tools, artifacts, and books that they use, and the communities and practices in which they participate."

Greeno, J., Collins, A., & Resnick, L. (1996). *Cognition and learning*. In D. Berliner & R. Calfee (Eds.), Handbook of educational psychology (pp. 15–46). Macmillan.

# behaviorist/empiricist view

## "When people's knowledge is viewed as their having associations between ideas or stimuli and responses, learning is the formation, strengthening, and adjustment of those associations"

# cognitivist view

## "understanding is gained by an active process of construction rather than by passive assimilation of information or rote memorization"

# situative view

## "When knowing is viewed as practices of, communities and the abilities of individuals to participate in those practices, then learning is the strengthening of those practices and participatory abilities."
