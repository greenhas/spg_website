# "As I’ve said before, there’s a tendency to look at a news article that you’ve modeled using your CMS and delivered into a browser window and say, 'That’s my content.'"

# "But it’s not. That’s a web page. It just happens to be displaying your news article. Your news article and the web page it rode in on are not the same thing."

# what gets combined with a content object to produce the presentation?

---

class: center, middle

# let's compare [the presentation of a content object](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/myself/2025-08-15-this-was/) with the ["raw" content object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenhas/spg_website/refs/heads/master/content/Myself/2025-08-15-This-was.md)

# "The key here is to separate your content in its pure form – its raw, naked data – from the ways in which it’s used."

## Deane Barker, *[Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices](https://deanebarker.net/books/squirrel/output-management/)*
---

# two types of separation 

## (from source cited in Barker, [Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/examining-the-separation-between-presentation-and-content/)):

--

* ### "Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the 'presentation' is the use of colors, fonts, etc."

--

* ### "Content from other content, so Content A is independent from Content B, and the 'presentation' is the potential combination of the two"

---

# why separate content from presentation?

--

* ## allow for multiple forms of presentation (example: [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com))

--

* ## repackage content for different channels (example: [web ➡️ RSS ➡️ social](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/index.xml))

--

* ## modify presentation *once* (example: ["franchise" vs. "Franchise" typo](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/myself/2025-08-15-this-was/))
