# "we separate [content objects] from [which] two separate things"?

---

---

# two types of separation 

## (from source cited in Barker, [Examining the Separation Between Presentation and Content](https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/examining-the-separation-between-presentation-and-content/)):

--

* ### "Content from its aesthetic surroundings, so the 'presentation' is the use of colors, fonts, etc."

--

* ### "Content from other content, so Content A is independent from Content B, and the 'presentation' is the potential combination of the two"

---

# let's compare [the presentation of a content object](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/myself/2025-08-15-this-was/) with the ["raw" content object](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenhas/spg_website/refs/heads/master/content/Myself/2025-08-15-This-was.md)

## (here's the [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenhas/spg_website/refs/heads/master/themes/ananke_custom_2023/layouts/_default/book.html), if you're interested)

---

# why separate content from presentation?

--

* ## allow for multiple forms of presentation (example: [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com))

--

* ## repackage content for different channels (example: [web ➡️ RSS ➡️ social](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/index.xml))

--

* ## modify presentation *once* (example: ["franchise" vs. "Franchise" typo](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/myself/2025-08-15-this-was/))

# content aggregation

--

> *An intentional grouping of content for the purposes of organization or presentation*

Deane Barker, [Web Content Management glossary](https://deanebarker.net/tech/glossary/aggregation/)

--

### [content aggregation for presentation](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/work/new-edition-of-my-remixed-data-science-textbook/)

--

### [content aggregation for organization](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/tags/ict-661/)

---

# CMS features that support content aggregation

--

* ## menus

--

* ## taxonomies

--

* ## other?

---

class: center, middle

# [example of taxonomies](https://spencergreenhalgh.com/research)

---

# serial

--

* ## organized "in a line"

--


* ## [YouTube playlist/music album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYRp8oP0yiw&list=OLAK5uy_n_KoKi3ioPEsTMStsk_DIjRjvSZwBbIhg)

---

# hierarchical

--

* ## organized like a family tree, with "parent" and "child" content

--

* ## menus and categories are especially helpful here

--

* ## [Fantasy Flight Games website](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/#/universe)
    
---

# tabular

--
    
* ## organized in a table or database and then accessed through searching

--

* ## [randombundlegame.com](https://randombundlegame.com/)
    
---

# network

--

* ## organized through links between content

--

* ## [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese)
    
---

# relational

--

* ## similar to hierarchical, but different content types and different relationships are more tightly defined

--

* ## [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080297/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3)

---

# implicit vs. explicit aggregation

--

* ## implicit aggregation is built off of _internal_ characteristics of the content

--

* ## explicit aggregation is defined _externally_ to the content itself

---

# static vs. dynamic aggregation

--

* ## static aggregation is hand-picked and arbitrary

--

* ## dynamic aggregation is automatically-generated and based on criteria

---

# fixed vs. variable aggregation

--

* ### both of these derive from dynamic aggregations

--

* ### a fixed aggregation is the same every time for everyone

--

* ### a variable aggregation changes based on context
