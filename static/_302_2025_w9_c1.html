# ICT 302/315 handoff

class: center, middle

# what is "content"?

---

# two defining characteristics of content

## According to [Barker](https://deanebarker.net/books/squirrel/the-basics/#h1), content is information that is:

--

* ## created by editorial process, and

--

* ## intended for consumption by a human audience

# how does [Dinosaur Comics](https://qwantz.com) pay the bills?

---

class: center, middle

# what are other ways of making content worth the time, effort, and money that goes into it?

---

class: center, middle

# in your 315 groups, discuss the solution that you've proposed

## what content might your solution need to be successful?

## what kinds of content *are part of* the solution? what kinds of content *support* the solution?

### (make sure everyone is on the same page!)

class: center, middle

# hand-off

## group 1 will develop content for group 2's solution

## group 2 will develop content for group 3's solution

## group 3 will develop content for group 4's solution

## group 4 will develop content for group 5's solution

## group 5 will develop content for group 1's solution

---

class: center, middle

## one person from each group should sit down with the remaining members of the group who is working on their solution (so, one person from group 2 should sit with group 1, etc.)

## through Teams, deliver a copy of your 315 solution proposal for the 302 group's reference

## discuss what kind of website/content makes the most sense for that solution

## this is ultimately up to the 302 groups, but "contractors" should still be deferential to "clients"

# Hugo content creation review

---

class: center, middle

# how does everyone feel about creating new pieces of content?

---

class: center, middle

# (almost) every piece of content on a Hugo website is represented by a file

## let's look at [an example](https://github.com/naehrjack/ict302-3/tree/main/content)

## (this gives us other ways of creating content!)

---

class: center, middle

# is there any content on your website that isn't the result of one of the files you've created in your groups?

---

class: center, middle

# a content type is made up of attributes

# in your theme, do pages and posts use or display different attributes?

---

class: center, middle

# (almost) all of us have content located in different sections; sections in Hugo are typically indicated by the location of a file

## let's look at [an example](https://github.com/naehrjack/ict302-3/tree/main/content)

---

# Hugo final project review

---

# an A-level final project will include:

--

* ### more than ten content files, with no placeholder content

--

* ### content files divided between more than two content types, more than one file associated with at least two content types

--

* ###  content files appearing in more than two different sections, more than one file associated with at least two different sections

--

* ### more than two aggregation schemes (menus, taxonomies) on the website

--

* ### a customized theme, effective multimedia, and few (if any) errors in content formatting
