# practical and technical questions

---

class: center, middle

# "I opened research-specific accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Carers UK's online forum to allow me to communicate with others on these sites."

Hope (2016)

---

class: center, middle

# "It's not uncommon for research groups/projects to create specific social media accounts."

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

# "Is there any difference between using personal accounts and using research specific accounts? What would a research specific account do that a personal account might not be able to?"

Amanda

# "What would make a researcher want this separate account beyond being anonymous?"

Jenna

class: center, middle

# "Social media technologies collapse multiple audiences into single contexts, making it difficult for people to use the same techniques online that they do to handle multiplicity in face-to-face conversation."

Marwick, A. E., & boyd, d. (2010). I tweet honestly, I tweet passionately: Twitter users, context collapse, and the imagined audience. *New Media & Society*, *13*(1), 114-133. https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444810365313

# "This level of planning for when to post is kind of fascinating. It shows how online recruitment still relies on timing, not just reach. Does this count as part of our methods section or just background work?"

# data and datafication

---

class: center, middle

# what is datafication?

## "more focused on data?" 

Jenna

## "maybe more so numbers as well"

Jo-Anna

## "put in data format"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "unearthing data from material that no one thought held any value" (p. 76)

# "To datafy a phenomenon is to put it in a quantified format so it can be tabulated and analyzed." (p. 78)

## "Can we even imagine a physical classroom where these things occur? An instructor looks over the shoulders of students to make sure they spend the appropriate amount of time on each page. Another puts a stopwatch to each student to track all sorts of things students do with the learning materials. One professor hooks students up to an eye-tracking device to make sure they can see exactly what the student sees"

Eaton, L. (2021). The new LMS rule: Transparency working both ways. *The Journal of Interactive Technology & Pedagogy*, 20. https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/read/the-new-lms-rule-transparency-working-both-ways-3a998d1f-b989-4100-881b-1a43968543c0/

# "we do not consider data as neutral or ready-made entities"

Latzo-Toth et al. (2022)

---

class: center, middle

# "Is it possible to scale up without losing what makes the data meaningful in the first place?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "what would be lost if we dropped ‘small data’ research?"

Latzo-Toth et al. (2022)

---

class: center, middle

# "I almost don't like referring to it as 'small data.' It seems to frame it as the shadow of big data instead of its own different valuable methodology. And feels maybe a little patronizing lol"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "How can we keep data manageable and yet obtain enough information to make conclusions?"

Amanda

# "How small can small data be? Is this context specific?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "This feels validating for my project (and I think a few others in this class) because we'll have a small N but deep analysis. Could be a helpful quote to defend our sample size?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Isn't the whole point of the survey to make sure people complete it? If it's not complete, is it still viable for the study?"

Jenna

class: center, middle

# "How would eye contact come in here? Especially since VoIP is mainly voice based."

# context and thickening data

---

class: center, middle

## "A lot of references has been made to qualitative social media research, are there any recommend strategies that could also work for people conducting quantitative social media research? Or at best, can data thickening be applied quantitatively, drawing from the three layers, specifically?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "Can we have thick data without necessarily addressing [interviews]?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "How would it be when we do not look at the context before generating and working on data?"

# "Consequently, participants engaged more genuinely during the interviews, revealing a lot about their values, political beliefs, and motivations. In the end, long-term observation contributed to thickening the data of every layer: contextualization, description, and signification gained from this strategy"

Latzko-Toth et al. (2022)

class: center, middle

# "This sounds like it might be a lot of work to do especially considering that platforms are different in their own ways. Have you had any experience with this?"

# getting more interactive

---

class: center, middle

# "In what we have learned so far I would say our position has been outsider and not interactive. However, this would change the trajectory as we might have to interact with the users to get the data desired."

Jenna

class: center, middle

# "Is this basically how we’re still able to work around disappearing APIs?"

Lauren

# on downloading your own data

---

class: center, middle

# "I think this could tie into the Latzko-toth et al (2022) piece and make the data 'thick'."

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "the data might not be used for the right reasons. I think ethics would play a part in this as well as the IRB."

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "Note that participants are being paid for their data! How do you feel about this?"

Spencer

class: center, middle

# "I’m not dealing with DMs in my study, but voiceover transcriptions might need similar care?"
