# "It’s kind of wild to think that something as small as a ‘like’ could be part of a bigger story about who we are."

Lauren

# "Studios don’t disclose ticket sales by region, so we did the next best thing, looking at how many active Facebook users in a given county 'liked' each of the nominees. Studios increasingly use Facebook as a home base for films, with photos, videos and news regularly fed to fans."

Barnes, B., & Katz, J. (2017, February 24). Where Oscar Best Picture nominees are liked most. *The New York Times* https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/24/movies/oscars-state-by-state-movie-popularity.html

# "like if someone posts #blessed on Instagram, we might assume they’re super happy, but really they could be joking, showing off, or just using it for likes"

# "born digital data"

---

class: center, middle

# "One of the common issues with interpreting digital trace data is that there are minimal contextual cues to help researchers discern meaning or intention from the authors of those traces."

Nevin et al. (2022)

# "Would the process of a virtual ethnography help with this?"

Ashley

## "The authors discuss DezNat as if it were a clearly defined object of study, that is, as if it had one author/contributor or at least a consistent, agreed upon approach, creed, or anything else—in this paper, it is treated as a religious movement. But DezNat is a hashtag and should be studied as such; a hashtag is not a community defined by any standard measure, and a hashtag as a community has no theoretical precedence."

van Dijck (2013)

# "What is the relationship between these two?"

Amanda

## "While it would be virtually impossible to inventory all platforms and their individual evolutions, it makes analytical sense to distinguish various types of social media."

# theory

# "While I certainly subscribe to this view on an ontological level, for analytical purposes it is often functional to distinguish between these actors if only to explain their indivisible yet changing relationship."

# actor-network theory

* ## comes out of science and technology studies

* ## more *relativist* than theories you may be used to

* ## originally associated with French—and other European—academics

# "supports a view of platforms as sociotechnical ensembles and performative infrastructures."

van Dijck (2013)

# "What does this mean?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

## "The basic idea of the performative idiom is that the world is full of agency. Human beings are agents, in the traditional voluntarist sense delineated within the representational idiom, and in other ways besides; but so is nature: the material world is continually acting, too. Think of the weather, bubble chambers, machine tools, TV sets, atom bombs"

# "Like, Instagram only is Instagram because of all the constant interactions between code, users, content, policies, etc. It makes the platform feel way more alive and unstable."

Van Dijck (2013)

# "Is this term referring to social identity?"

Albert

class: center, middle

# "Which figurations are they endowed with?"

van Dijck (2013)

## "Figurations are ‘networks of individuals’ (Elias 1978: 15) or, in more encompassing terms, actors, including collectivities and organizations. These actors constitute, by their interaction, larger social entities. Therefore, figuration is a ‘simple conceptual tool’ to understand social domains in terms of ‘models of processes of interweaving’ (Elias 1978: 30, 130)."

Hepp, A., & Hasebrink, U. (2018). Researching transforming communications in times of deep mediatization: A figurational approach. In A. Hepp, A. Breiter, & U. Hasebrink (Eds.), *Communicative figurations: Transforming communications in times of deep mediatization* (pp. 15-48). Palgrave Macmillan.

# "The struggle to dominate the realm of social media is led by power holders called “programmers”—those who program networks and platforms—and “switchers”—those who have the ability to connect and ensure cooperation of different networks."

van Dijck (2013), describing Castells (2009)

---

class: center, middle

# "How do “programmers” actually encode sociality, and how do users resist or bend imputed meanings?"

van Dijck (2013)

# "Interesting. What does resistance look like in this context?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "User agency, in the context of social media, is a complex and multifaceted concept, not least because it encompasses both conscious human activity and the 'technological unconscious.''"

van Dijck (2013)

# "What does this mean?"
