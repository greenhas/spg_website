# "Anderson was dealing with societies forging a new social identity by emphasizing a common—somewhat artificially constructed—community. He focused on such developing societies as Indonesia, where the authorities have tried to construct a common identity out of thousands of islands and ethnic groups."

Gruzd et al. (2011)

# "My biggest concern is with the last condition, 'sustained membership over time'. Why can't people leave an online community for a time then come back to it? Or is it referring to something else?"

Jenna

# "The level of membership stability required for a reasonable level of interactivity will also relate to the density of CMC messages (message postings per­unit of time). For example, IRC has a fairly high density of postings in comparison to many email lists and therefore does not require the same stability of membership to produce interactive discussions."

## "This sounds like a polite academic way of saying: “Cool finding, but now do something with it.” It’s not enough to just show that data predicts something—you need to connect that insight to a broader theory or strategy. Big mood for social media metrics too, where we often celebrate likes or shares without asking what they actually mean or how they should guide future decisions."

# "It shocks me that out of this huge sum of articles, only 31% cited theoretical works. We are constantly told how important theory is, but is that legit or could part of it be the culture of the university?"

# "we have manually coded 35 references that are most frequently cited in each of the 11 sub-themes (i.e., a total of 357 references examined), defining the references as ‘theoretically oriented’ if one or more theoretical perspectives are explicitly present in the reference"

## "Big data analytics’ trouble is that it often does not connect statistical and computational research results to a broader analysis of human meanings, interpretations, experiences, attitudes, moral values, ethical dilemmas, uses, contradictions and macro-sociological implications of social media."

Fuchs (2017)

# "I believe that there is a collective sociological reality, which is independent of the individual. As I see it, individual decisions are always made within the framework of this sociological reality, itself pre-existent and more or less determinative."

### "To check for whether Twitter fulfills needs and provides social cohesion, we conducted a content analysis of 600 tweets, a subset of our larger sample of Wellman’s tweets described in Section 4.2 that covers messages posted between April and August 2009. Specifically, we looked for instances where network members provided support or were supported by other members. We found many messages that volunteer useful information to others, often in the form of URLs to external sites or articles. For example, 35% (195) of 600 tweets in the sample included a URL. This suggests that people rely on Twitter not only to connect to other people, but also to connect to information."
