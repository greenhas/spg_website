# "Yet another manifestation of this theme was the use of MTs—or modified tweets—to redirect someone else’s tweet to the attention of the MAET community. Although the MT convention has since largely disappeared in favor of Twitter’s ‘‘quote tweet’’ function, it was at this time a standard way to comment on and redirect tweets."

# "Ads can be ‘as good as content.’Sandberg is echoing something we heard from Zuckerberg, her former boss, over the past few days. That’s the idea that just because consumers might see more ads in Meta’s apps, doesn’t mean the experience is getting worse. Sandberg says ads in features like stories are not very intrusive, and Meta can tell users are still having a good experience based on whether they’re stopping and engaging with the ads."

### "Apartheid, for all its power, had fatal flaws baked in, starting with the fact that it never made any sense. Racism is not logical. consider this: Chinese people were classified as black in South Africa. I don’t mean they were running around acting black. They were still Chinese. But, unlike Indians, there weren’t enough Chinese people to warrant devising a whole separate classification. Apartheid, despite its intricacies and precision, didn’t know what to do with thiem, so the government said, “Eh, we’ll just call ‘em black. It’s simpler that way.”"

### "Interestingly, at the same time, Japanese people were labeled as white. The reason for this was that the South African government wanted to establish good relations with the Japanese in order to import their fancy cars and electronics. So Japanese people were given honorary white status while Chinese people stayed black. I always like to imagine being a South African policeman who likely couldn’t tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese but whose job was to make sure that people of the wrong color weren’t doing the wrong thing. If he saw an Asian person sitting on a whites-only bench, what would he say?"
