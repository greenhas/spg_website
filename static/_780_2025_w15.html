# "There's an interesting value judgment in here. I'm not contesting the importance of validity, reliability, reproducibility, or scalability, but I also think it's ~~important~~ [possible] to do high-quality scientific research without them."

Spencer

# "I want to know more!!!"

Albert

# "can we discuss [neural networks] a little further?"

# "What would a unit composed of four words or more be called?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "A lot of scholarship here. What is the general critical argument?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "What is a corpus?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "In terms of visuals is he looking at transcribing into text or something else?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# " These three steps combine for an efficient, rigorous, and fully reliable and reproducible computational grounded theory."

Nelson (2020)

# "Is this gearing towards the fact that this blended approach is automatically free from the researcher biases indicated earlier?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "finally use structural techniques to uncover latent structures in the cultural landscape, directly, they claim, measuring meaning structures"

Nelson (2020)

# "What does this mean?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "I think computational analysis is fantastic for helping a researcher quickly pick up on possible patterns in the data."

Spencer

# "Does that mean it is an easy way out to doing analyses that require much time and resources?"

Albert

# sentiment analysis

---

class: center, middle

# "Sentiment analysis kind of makes me think of customer satisfaction surveys or something of that sort. Helping companies see the pros and cons to what they are doing through their consumer's eyes."

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "Do these sentiment analysis account for emojis?"

Jo-Anna

---

## "Symbolic artificial intelligence consists of a huge variety of different models (linear and logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, nearest neighbours, support vector machines, and so on) that are used to analyze variables that represent meaningful concepts or symbols."

McLevey & Crick (2022)

# "Would emojis be classified as a part of this?"

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "whether the expressed sentiment, sometimes referred to as ‘valence', is positive or negative (i.e. ‘polarity’ or ‘orientation') and how strong it is (e.g. very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive)"

McLevey & Crick (2022)

# "Can you explain this part a little further and also provide some instances where this could be applied to internet research?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "If I’m using a lexicon, I guess I really need to check whether I can see the rules and dictionary behind it?"\

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# `bag-of-words` vs. `contextual representation`

# "What would be an example of where we would use each of these?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "While the dictionary might be helpful does this account for the context it is used in?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "Imagine going through all of the individual words in your data to assign all of them sentiment values!"

Spencer

# "That seems tedious…any computerized way to go about this?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "I would not have expected IMDB to be the benchmark. How does this work?"

Ashley

# reproducibility

---

class: center, middle

# "content analysis is not easily reproducible"

Nelson (2020)

# "Does it need to be?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "we assume the computational subfield to be ahead of others in Communication Science regarding the efforts (and struggles) to make transparency and reproducibility the norm."

Chan et al. (2024)

# "Are they arguing this because the nature of the work requires better documentation?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "The emphasis on 'effort' sounds like this is not something that researchers would typically do. Are there any downsides to documenting this process that researchers experience?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "But a paper with all the code and data made available does not automatically become reproducible either"

Chan et al. (2024)

# "I always assumed if someone posted their code, it had to be reproducible. Not so much, apparently."

Lauren

# "So it is a double-edged sword."

Jo-Ann

---

class: center, middle

# " a result is reproducible 'when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.''"

Chan et al. (2024), quoting The Turing Way Community (2022)

# "Does 'consistently' here take into account various forms, demographics etc?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "what are some other examples [of repositories]?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "Is Quarto related to a particular program?"

Albert
