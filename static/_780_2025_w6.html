# "As the new Congress has already started working on legislation to protect kids from social media harms, Roblox is doubling down on its efforts to convince lawmakers it shouldn’t be lumped in with products like Instagram and YouTube."

Feiner, L. (February 14, 2025). Roblox is still trying to convince lawmakers it's not social media. *The Verge*. https://www.theverge.com/policy/612577/roblox-kids-online-safety-legislation-social-media

# what is (good) research?

---

class: center, middle

# "Social media research so far is not a defined discipline."

Mayr & Weller (2017)

---

class: center, middle

# "Do you have a specific example [of obsolete guidelines] in mind?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Has this changed much since this was published?"

Lauren

class: center, middle

# what is a "discipline"?

---

class: center, middle

# what is a "methodology"?

---

class: center, middle

# where does internet research fit in all of this?

---

class: center, middle

# "Would it be overly reductive to just say that quant uses statistics and qual uses words?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "How often have we read that meta analysis isn't possible, or if it is then it is deeply flawed, because a lack of consensus on everything from definitions to approaches."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "This makes me think about how major events, like elections or viral controversies, often drive social media research. But do we over-prioritize big moments and miss out on studying everyday digital life?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Remember boyd and Crawford's critique of 'Big Data' as having to do more with mythology than with size."

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

# "some of the data encompassed by Big Data (e.g. all Twitter messages about a particular topic) are not nearly as large as earlier data sets that were not considered Big Data (e.g. census data)"

boyd & Crawford (2012)

---

class: center, middle

# "Big Data is less about data that is big than it is about a capacity to search, aggregate, and cross-reference large data sets."

boyd & Crawford (2012)

---

class: center, middle

*Technology*, *Analysis*, *Mythology*

boyd & Crawford (2012)

class: center, middle

# "It is important to note that manual data collection is labour-intensive. While it may be appropriate for narrowly focused, qualitative studies, it can hardly be used for any ‘big data'-style social media research."

Voss et al. (2017)

# "This is what I was planning to do as my study is qualitive and small in scope :)"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "I've never heard manual copying and pasting referred to as web scraping! I feel a bit resistant to that (I think of web scraping in automated/computational terms), but that may be a gatekeeping instinct that I need to overcome."

Spencer

---

class: center, middle

# "Instead of just collecting data, researchers and participants actively shape it together. But how much unnatural influence does this method introduce? Could it lead to results that feel more constructed than organic?"

Lauren

# methodological questions

---

class: center, middle

# "A colleague and I have taken screenshots of posts on Twitter (X) for a proposal before. Is this approach to collecting data related to textual analyses?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "What is (unproportionally) excluded if I collect data this way?"

Mayr & Weller (2017)

# "Can this be controlled everytime?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

### "This includes selecting the most appropriate social media channels, selecting the timeframe for data collection, constantly checking upon newly created user accounts or relevant hashtags, thinking about keywords that relate to different language communities"

Mayr & Weller (2017)

### "is it the case that social media researchers follow all the time? What makes this difficult to do?"

Albert

### "I wonder how much of what we know about social media behavior is just a reflection of what’s easier to study rather than what’s most representative."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "I think this might lead to a very large dataset - even if we decide to study a particular event. How can we scale down? Perhaps focusing on research questions and research objectives might come in handy in such instances."

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "We used Twitter Archiving Google Sheets (Hawksey, 2014) to collect tweets containing the #bac2018 hashtag during the month prior to the beginning of the exams on 18 June. This process resulted in the identification of 8523 original tweets"

Greenhalgh et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

# "We elected to limit our focus to the 1% of original tweets (n = 85) that were retweeted the most as of November 2018 (when we collected tweet metadata)"

Greenhalgh et al. (2021)

---

class: center, middle

## "In contrast, the top 85 most-retweeted posts represented 160,005 of the 199,953 demonstrable instances of the tweets in our dataset as of November 2018 (i.e., 8523 original tweets and 191,430 retweets of them). Thus, coding the top 1% of original tweets was functionally equivalent to analyzing 80% of activity after accounting for retweets, ensuring broad representation of the phenomenon as actually experienced—and despite a large dataset."

Greenhalgh et al. (2021)

# "What are some pros and cons of each [insider and outsider status] that come to mind?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "If you are to some extent an insider to a community, you might be more welcomed when received. I.e. if you were collecting data on queer people and identified yourself as a queer researcher when approaching the community, they may feel more comfortable with you."

Ashley

class: center, middle

# "You might not always understand the data you're studying as an outsider."

# data storage

---

class: center, middle

# "what are flat files?"

Amanda

# "Is this your most effective way of storing data? or do you do it another way?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "I'm fairly certain I understand this, but it doesn't seem like they fully explained what the index is or how it can be done other than mentioning popular tools."

Jenna

class: center, middle

# "Arguably, data that are not (yet) shared with others require the same stewardship as datasets deposited into public archives."

Voss et al. (2017)

---

class: center, middle

# "Is it because even you as the researcher can mishandle it?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "The main reason why i might do this as a researcher fundamentally might be to further my research or produce other papers from the same data set."

Amanda

# legal and ethical questions

---

class: center, middle

# "Twitter's Developer Policy forbids the preservation of deleted tweets – thus an important part of a conversation may be missing from a harvest resulting in an incomplete record in the archive"

Voss et al. (2017)

---

class: center, middle

# "If we have sceenshots of deleted Tweets is it okay to use them for our research then?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "If a researcher wants to publish reproductions of individual posts that contain images or other copyright-protected content, they may need permission"

Voss et al. (2017)

---

class: center, middle

# "Is this applicable to all platforms?"

Amanda

# "I have been saving some GamerGate webcomics and memes. I wonder if any of those images would potentially be copyright-protected"

Ashley
