# "R is an interpreted language"

Ismay et al. (2024), chapter 1

# Does it mean it is a programming language?

# "This means you have to type in commands written in R code. In other words, you have to code/program in R."

Ismay et al. (2024), chapter 1

# "I'm certain this provides more flexibility and opportunity than traditional analysis software, but I bet it can also be frustrating for beginners."
