class: center, middle

# the state of internet research

---

class: center, middle

# "... have led to calls for companies like Facebook to allow more access to data for researchers (Metcalf and Fiesler 2018)."

Fiesler et al. (2020)

# "I think a lot has changed so far…what do you think led to these reforms, as access to data is not readily open to researchers like it used to be?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "Makes me wonder how much social media companies benefit from this research while still trying to restrict access."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Would we still consider Twitter the 'model organism' with the changes that has happened with it between the publication of this article and now?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "What's the most reliable way to know if a site has an API?"

Lauren

# "Are there situations where scraping is actually preferable to an API?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Is having reliable data still a guarantee? Without using API?"

Amanda

# ethical and legal issues

---

class: center, middle

# "However, ethics by its very nature rarely has right or wrong answers, only those that are culturally and normatively informed."

Fiesler et al. (2020)

---

class: center, middle

# "Moreover, the creation of gender recognition technology has the potential to do direct harm to the transgender community (Hamidi, Scheuerman, and Branham 2018)"

(Fiesler et al., 2020)

---

class: center, middle

# "Research has also shown that, regardless of this lack of understanding, many users still feel legally and morally bound by TOS and related documents—regardless of whether they are presented as legally binding (Wilkinson-Ryan 2017)."

Fiesler et al. (2020)

---

class: center, middle

# "What happens when ethics and legal concerns contradict each other? For example, if violating TOS is technically illegal but leads to research that benefits public health, is that justified?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Do they really respond to requests for data collection? Is there a formal process?"

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

# "TOS are often designed to be as broad as possible, and therefore it may not be in the site’s best interest to be specific, and to provide context, but as a researcher it makes informed decision-making very difficult."

(Fiesler et al., 2020)

# "Why is this the case? I think there should be a simple way around this?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "This means that as long as you limit your scraping to facts, copyright protection does not apply."

Wickham et al. (2023)

# "How is this done? How can a researcher do this?"

Albert

# HTML and technical questions

---

class: center, middle

# "It's kind of wild to think about how much of the internet relies on something created in 1989. It makes me wonder if web standards will always evolve around this foundation or if something completely new could replace it."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Is there a reason that it's called HTML but uses http?"

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# " The `<head>` and `<body>` tags are directly enclosed by the `<html>` element; the `<title>` element is enclosed by the `<head>` tag."

Munzert et al. (2015)

---

class: center, middle

# "As some characters are needed for the markup, they cannot be used literally in the content."

Munzert et al. (2015)

# `<p>5 < 6 but 7 > 3 </p>`

# "What would be the difference between unordered lists and description lists?"

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "does that mean the biggest challenge in scraping is just figuring out that structure?"

Lauren

# "if the structure of the site changes, then you’ll have to change your scraping code."

Wickham et al. (2023)

class: center, middle

# "Do you recommend we download [SelectorGadget]?"

Lauren
