# "APIs are highly dynamic"

Janetzko (2022)

# "What factors might account for this?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "How does the authentication work?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "Is token similar to an access key?"

Albert

---

class: center, middle

# "Note that the API key (consumer token) und API secret (consumer secret) displayed here have been modified and will not work."

Janetzko (2022)

# researcher access to APIs (or data)

---

class: center, middle

# "Twitter let researchers use essentially the same API for 8 years and then overhauled everything?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Does all the money collected from researchers go to the company you're paying (in this case Twitter)? "

Jenna

---

class: center, middle

# "I wonder why companies are so opposed to researchers. Wouldn't it make sense to want researchers to help better the product?"

Jenna

# "I wonder how different things might look if they treated researchers in a somewhat similar way as they do creators."

Amanda

class: center, middle

# "recent restrictions that Facebook put on the Instagram application programming interface (API)"

Gruzd et al. (2022)

# "Is this through Meta?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "I wonder if the same restrictions are happening in other fields that rely on platform data like journalism, finance, etc."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "I've never heard of [TwapperKeeper]. But can we use it today to collect data?"

Jo-Anna

---

class: center, middle

# "What does that look like? What did [Texifter] do to target scholars?"

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "While less critical for most scholarly purposes, these changes reveal a growing desire for Twitter to position its own apps and Website as the only legitimate point of access to Twitter content "

Bruns (2019)

---

class: center, middle

# "I hadn‚Äôt realized Twitter gave its entire archive to the Library of Congress. I wonder what kind of access scholars actually had to that data, or if it ended up being more symbolic."

# [example RSS feed 2](https://uknow.uky.edu/rss.xml)

# "I often forget how much is collected behind the scenes, or rather, I am not thinking about it when I am using social media."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Netlytic first removes common words"

Gruzd et al., (2022)

# "Does this happen automatically or does one need to manually specify what stopwords need to be eliminated?"

Amanda

---

class: center, middle

# "Word clouds always seem like a simple way to analyze data, but I wonder if they can be misleading."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "What does it mean for a Twitter handle to be a 'frequently mentioned term'?"

Spencer

## a better way of asking this: how is a Twitter handle different than other "frequently mentioned terms"?

---

class: center, middle

# "This made me think about how different these two interactions are. A mention might just be tagging someone, but a reply usually means an actual conversation is happening."

Lauren

---

class: center, middle

# "Twitter users that dominated the discourse in each dataset either because of their online or offline actions (or both)."

Gruzd et al. (2022)

---

class: center, middle

# "high-level concepts such as anger, disappointment, happiness, satisfaction, social presence"

Gruzd et al. (2022)

# "How do the researchers group high-level concepts like that?"

# "Can you think of ways that organizing collective action might be missed by the method that are used in this example case?"

Spencer

# "This dataset collects the word 'Ukraine' in three languages. Its possible that we are missing lots of instances of collective action from tweets that do not have the word Ukraine in them."

Ashley

---

class: center, middle

## "What had happened was that as soon as the protest became the dominant story, large numbers of people continued to discuss them heavily ‚Äì almost to the point that no other discussion took place on their Twitter feeds ‚Äì but stopped using the hashtags except to draw attention to a new phenomenon or to engage in 'trending topic wars' with ideologically-opposing groups. While the protests continued, and even intensified, the hashtags died down."

Tufekci (2014)

---

# "In sum, the results suggest that during the crisis in Ukraine, Twitter was used primarily for information dissemination purposes and not to organize collective action."

Gruzd et al. (2022)

---

class: center, middle

# "Basically, Facebook tweaked users' feeds, prioritizing different kinds of content to see if that would affect how they posted. It was a really creepy move."

Spencer

# "Was this a sort of turning point in how informed consent is managed on social media?"

Lauren

# "What was done about this?"

Albert

## "What are some of the key elements of this app? Were there specific traits that were being measured/tracked?"

Amanda Gyesi

## "The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time."
